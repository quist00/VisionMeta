44841.jpg	Death of the Historical Buddha (Nehan-zu)		Japan	14th century	Essential tenets of Buddhism are explicit in paintings of the Buddha Shakyamuni’s nirvana, his passing from earthly life to the ultimate goal of an enlightened being: release from the bonds of existence through negation of desires that cause life’s intrinsic suffering. Facing westward in a final trance after a long life of teaching, the golden body of the Buddha bears the marks of his enlightened nature. Short curls covering his head indicate his ascetic life, while elongated earlobes adorned with heavy jewelry reflect his birth as a prince. A cranial protuberance and a circle of light between his brows attest to his penetrating wisdom.Those witnessing the Buddha’s passing from earthly life reveal their own imperfect level of enlightenment in the extent of their grief. Bodhisattvas, who have achieved the spiritual enlightenment of Buddhahood, show a solemn serenity. Except for the Bodhisattva Jizō, who appears as a monk holding a jewel near the center of the bier, these deities are envisioned in princely raiment covering their golden bodies. Shaven-headed disciples weep bitterly, as do the multi-limbed Hindu deities and guardians who have been converted to the Buddha’s teaching. Men and women of every class, joined by more than thirty animals, grieve in their imperfect understanding of the Buddhist ideal. Even the blossoms of the sala trees change hue, as Queen Maya, mother of the Buddha, descends weeping from upper right.	涅槃図 Title: Death of the Historical Buddha (Nehan-zu) Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 77 1/2 × 74 1/4 in.

45596.jpg	Monju Bosatsu with Eight Sacred Sanskrit Syllables		Japan	mid- to late 14th century	Monju (Sanskrit: Manjushri), the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, is seated on a lion against an ovoid nimbus edged with flames. He wears a crown decorated with eight miniature Buddhas and holds a sword and a long stemmed lotus flower supporting a vajra—a pronged implement with origins in Indian weaponry. In other manifestations of the bodhisattva, Monju’s lotus typically supports a Buddhist scripture, but here the vajra is an emblem of wisdom. Monju is surrounded by eight Sanskrit seed syllables, or sacred utterances symbolizing the eight guardian youths) from a mantra invoking him. Inscribed in the upper part of the painting is a verse praising Monju, dated to 1371 on the day following the arrival of winter. It says, “In the past, you were the bodhisattva Ryūshu, and in the future, you will become the Buddha Fuken, the patriarch of the Seven Buddhas, the mother who gives rise to wisdom [the Buddha], Great Master Monju!” The painting would have been used in rituals performed for the purpose of warding off natural disasters, and is said to have belonged to the temple Daigoji near Kyoto.	八字文殊菩薩像 Title: Monju Bosatsu with Eight Sacred Sanskrit Syllables Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: mid- to late 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Overall: 40 7/8 x 25 1/8 in.

45598.jpg	Welcoming Descent of the Bodhisattva Jizō		Japan	early 14th century	In addition to Amida Buddha, compassionate bodhisattvas such as Kannon and Jizō are also represented in welcoming descent, or raigō. Images of Jizō’s raigō originated in the Kamakura period and are often associated with practices at Kasuga Shrine in Nara (Japan’s ancient capital), where Jizō is one of the primary Buddhist deities of worship.	地蔵来迎図 Title: Welcoming Descent of the Bodhisattva Jizō Period: Kamakura (1185–1333) Date: early 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, gold, and cut gold leaf (kirikane) on silk Dimensions: Image: 42 in. × 15 7/8 in.

45428.jpg	Illustrated Legends of the Kitano Tenjin Shrine (Kitano Tenjin engi emaki)		Japan	late 13th century	An ancient Shinto belief that the unpredictable, calamitous forces of nature are animated by tormented human spirits (onryō) underlies the legendary origin of the Kitano Tenjin shrine, dedicated to Sugawara Michizane (845–903). Michizane was a distinguished scholar, poet, and statesman who died in exile, having been slandered by enemies at court.After his death, a series of extraordinary natural disasters and plagues caused the untimely deaths of his detractors. In an attempt to appease his vengeful spirit, he was posthumously pardoned and promoted to high office, but the disasters continued. In 942, Michizane’s spirit revealed his wish to be honored at a shrine dedicated to the thunder god in the northwestern section of the capital. He was deified as Tenjin, an ancient god of agriculture and patron of the falsely accused. Later, perhaps because poems were offered to him at the shrine, he came to be venerated as the Shinto god of literature and music. Among the more than thirty extant sets of handscrolls recounting Michizane’s life and the events leading to the establishment of the Tenjin cult, this version is second in age and quality only to the early thirteenth-century treasure in the main Kitano Tenjin shrine in Kyoto.The minister who had slandered Michizane took ill. He had a Buddhist monk chant mantras to dispel his sickness. When the monk did so, two blue dragons came out of the minister’s ears and announced Michizane’s intent to avenge his wrongful exile and death. Shortly thereafter, the minister fell dead. Despite the unpleasant event depicted in the scene, the scroll’s painter included a nicely executed painting-within-a painting of an early type of yamato-e (Japanese-style painting) landscape screen favored by the well-to-do. The rectilinear shapes on two of the panels are meant to indicate beautifully decorated papers, with poems praising the landscape in fine calligraphy.According to legend, Michizane was not born of human parents but miraculously appeared one day as a grown boy of five or six years of age in the garden of a courtier-scholar. The boy declared this courtier to be his father. The scene is depicted here, on the verandah of the courtier’s mansion. Ladies of the residence peek out at the curious pair. Though the related text is missing, the next painting here shows Michizane as a young man composing a poem at the request of the emperor. His foster father, himself a celebrated poet, looks on proudly.	北野天神縁起絵巻 Title: Illustrated Legends of the Kitano Tenjin Shrine (Kitano Tenjin engi emaki) Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: late 13th century Culture: Japan Medium: Set of five handscrolls; ink, color, and cut gold leaf (kirikane) on paper Dimensions: a: 11 5/16 in. × 22 ft. 7 7/16 in.

44983.jpg	Taima Mandala		Japan	probably late 14th century	This Taima mandala offers a resplendent vision of the Western Pure Land, a paradise over which Amida presides and to which he welcomes all beings who call upon his name. Amida sits enthroned at the center of the mandala, flanked by the bodhisattvas Seishi and Kannon and surrounded by throngs of musicians, dancers, celestial beings, and pavilions adorned with jewels. In the lower foreground is a lotus pond in which the faithful are reborn. Surrounding this scene are vignettes from the Contemplation Sutra that teach the living how to attain salvation. Mandalas of this type are based on Tang-dynasty Chinese images that were transmitted to Japan along with Pure Land Buddhist teachings during the Nara period (710–94). The earliest Japanese version is an eighth-century brocade approximately four times larger than the present mandala, and the primary object of worship at the Taima-dera Temple in Nara. The Museum’s Taima mandala was once worshipped at Shinzenkōji, a temple originally located in western Kyoto.	當麻曼荼羅図 Title: Taima Mandala Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: probably late 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; color and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 52 1/2 in. × 48 in.

45597.jpg	Miroku Bosatsu		Japan	14th century	Miroku Bosatsu (Sanskrit: Maitreya Bodhisattva), the future Buddha, resides in the Tushita heaven, awaiting rebirth on earth. He usually has a princely appearance and holds a stupa. Legends say that Vasubandhu and Asanga, the great Indian philosophers of the Hossō sect, received teachings directly from Miroku Bosatsu. Shell powder was not used to build up the surface underneath the application of gold, suggesting that the painting was probably produced at the end of the Kamakura period, before that practice became prevalent.	弥勒菩薩像 Title: Miroku Bosatsu Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 42 in. × 18 1/2 in.

45236.jpg	The Bodhisattva Monju (Manjushri) with Five Topknots		Japan	13th century	This variant form of the bodhisattva Monju, a deity associated with wisdom, is called Monju with Five Topknots (Gokei Monju). Imagined as a boy sitting cross-legged on a lotus pedestal, he holds his usual attributes: a sword and sacred text. A pair of Sanskrit letters above him stands for Dainichi, the buddha at the center of the Buddhist cosmos.	五髻文殊菩薩像 Title: The Bodhisattva Monju (Manjushri) with Five Topknots Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 13th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 36 3/4 × 20 3/4 in.

45369.jpg	Shaka (Shakyamuni) Triad		Japan	13th century	This painting shows Shaka in his fully enlightened state, enthroned and flanked by his bodhisattva attendants: Monju (Manjushri), riding a golden lion, and Fugen (Samantabhadra), riding a white elephant. Serving as the Buddha's active agents in this world, Monju stands for the wisdom of Buddhism and Fugen for its practice, particularly meditation and teaching. The pyramidal arrangement of the figures, with the transcendent Shaka at its apex and axis, projects the enduring nature of the faith. The subtle contrast between the broad-shouldered stasis of the Buddha and the animation of the bodhisattvas and their mounts is a pleasing visual interpretation of the theological meaning of the iconography. This straightforward yet richly painted icon reflects the revival of older Buddhist sects that accompanied the reform of mainstream Buddhism during the Kamakura period.	釈迦三尊像 Title: Shaka (Shakyamuni) Triad Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 13th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 42 1/4 x 22 3/4 in.

45370.jpg	Illustrated Biography of Prince Shōtoku (Shōtoku Taishi e-den)		Japan	14th century	Prince Shōtoku (574–622), a preeminent champion of Buddhism against the hereditary clans in charge of Shinto ritual, was venerated within a century after his death as an incarnation of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni. Monks told parables about him inspired by the life of the Buddha, and episodes from his life decorated temples and shrines, aiding the spread of popular Buddhism throughout medieval Japan. This hanging scroll and its pair depict sixty-two such scenes from the prince’s life, shown neither chronologically nor in an orderly spatial sequence but instead identified by accompanying inscriptions. Although Shōtoku lived during the early seventh century, when the capital was located in Asuka, these fourteenth-century paintings depict costumed figures, festive activities, and architectural settings inspired by the Kyoto imperial court during the Heian (794–1185) and Kamakura years.	聖徳太子絵伝図 Title: Illustrated Biography of Prince Shōtoku (Shōtoku Taishi e-den) Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: One of two hanging scrolls; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 67 5/8 x 33 1/4 in.

45630.jpg	Prince Shōtoku at Age Sixteen	In the Style of Toba Sōjō	Japanese	14th century	Imaginary portraits and legends about the life of Prince Shōtoku (574–622), the foremost proponent of Buddhism in Japan, emerged soon after his death. Based on the prince’s mid-Heian-period biography, this painting portrays him in a form in which he was often revered as a deified historical figure: at the age of sixteen, he prayed for his father, Emperor Yōmei (518–587), to recover from illness. The pose, which belongs to a category of portraiture known as kōyō-zō (images of filial piety), appears in both paintings and sculptures of young Shōtoku, which make up nearly half his extant portraits. Dressed in a monk’s robe, he holds a censer; his hair is arranged in the two loops of a youth and frames boyish, idealized features.	聖徳太子孝養図 (Shotoku Taishi kōyō zu)" Title: Prince Shōtoku at Age Sixteen Artist: In the Style of Toba Sōjō (Japanese, 1053–1140) Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 32 1/2 × 20 9/16 in.

45599.jpg	Welcoming Descent of the Bodhisattva Jizō	Unidentified artist		14th century	Veneration of the bodhisattva Jizō (Sanskrit: Kshitagarbha) became widespread during the Kamakura period. Among the iconographies associated with Jizō that originated in this period is this one, in which he manifests in the guise of a monk and rushes through the air to aid the suffering, especially those in hell. Derived from images of the Buddha Amida (Sanskrit: Amitābha) descending to welcome and escort a dying believer to his Pure Land, this painting portrays Jizō surfing the sky on a bank of cloud, his feet upon lotus pedestals. His monk’s robe is decorated with intricate patterns of cut gold. He carries a wishfulfilling jewel and a golden staff with six jangling rings, to announce his arrival.	地蔵菩薩来迎図 Title: Welcoming Descent of the Bodhisattva Jizō Artist: Unidentified artist Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and cut gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 36 1/2 x 15 1/2 in.

45372.jpg	Portrait of Xuanzang (Genjō) with Attendant	In the Style of Kasuga Motomitsu	Japanese	14th century	The Chinese monk Xuanzang (602–664), known as Genjō in Japan, translated a major body of Buddhist scripture from Sanskrit into Chinese. In Japan, he was honored as patriarch of the Hossō (Chinese: Faxiang) sect, and this painting would have been displayed by its monastic owners to validate the lineage and authority of their temple. Both Xuanzang’s mission to transmit the teachings and the painting that authenticates this transmission testify to the importance of lineage in Buddhist sects. Lineage is equally significant in the transmission of art and craft techniques in Japan, demonstrating a kinship between religious and artistic paradigms. Here, Xuanzang is depicted with an Indian acolyte, a reference to his travels to India in search of Buddhist teachings. The monk’s features are portrayed in taut “iron wire” lines derived from a Tang dynasty (618–907) representational mode used to connote venerable status.	伝春日基光筆 玄奘三蔵像 Title: Portrait of Xuanzang (Genjō) with Attendant Artist: In the Style of Kasuga Motomitsu (Japanese, active early 11th century) Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 48 3/4 x 29 1/4 in.

45591.jpg	Shaka Nyorai		Japan	14th century	Shaka Nyorai, or the historical Buddha Shakyamuni (the sage of the Shakya tribe who attained enlightenment), lived in India from about 563 to 483 B.C. He is portrayed here sitting cross-legged on a lotus throne above a five-tiered hexagonal pedestal. The most fundamental doctrine of Buddhism, Turning the Wheel of the Law, is embodied in Shaka's hand gesture, the mudra of preaching. He is illuminated by double disks of halos and by gold applied to his face and body. His robes drape gracefully over the throne. The strong frontality and symmetry enhance the strength of this devotional image.	釈迦如来像 Title: Shaka Nyorai Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 50 1/2 × 21 in.

Standing atop a cloud, with his left foot forward, a golden staff held against his shoulder, and wearing garments rich with delicate patterns in cut gold leaf, he turns to gaze at his follower with gentle vigilance. Popularly known as the Mikaeri Jizō (“Jizō looking back”), this type of image poignantly reflects faith in the bodhisattva’s merciful guidance through the sufferings of the six realms of existence (rokudō) to the bliss of Amida Buddha’s Western Paradise.	見返り地蔵菩薩図 Title: The Bodhisattva Jizō “Looking Back” Artist: Unidentified artist Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, gold paint (kindei), and cut gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 33 1/4 x 14 1/2 in.

45249.jpg	Welcoming Descent of Amida and Bodhisattvas	Unidentified artist		late 14th century	Like many of the works of art created to represent the Pure Land belief in salvation through faith, raigō ("welcoming descent") paintings like this one were indispensable religious furnishings at the time of death. Such raigo paintings depict the scene in which Amida (Sanskrit: Amitabha) and his attendants descend from heaven to take a believer back to the Western Paradise on a lotus throne. The scrolls were often hung by the bedside of the dying to ensure the prospect of rebirth in paradise. Since traditionally the dying lay with their heads to the north and their faces turned west, raigō paintings usually depict the Buddha and his entourage coming from the upper left down toward the lower right so as to meet the gaze of the dying. Sometimes silken cords were attached to Buddha's hand, offering the dying physical assistance during the journey to paradise.	阿弥陀聖衆来迎図 Title: Welcoming Descent of Amida and Bodhisattvas Artist: Unidentified artist Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: late 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 65 3/4 × 33 1/2 in.

45238.jpg	Portrait of Jion Daishi (Guiji)		Japan	14th century	Guiji (632–682), a Chinese Buddhist monk of the Tang dynasty, transmitted the Hossō sect teachings to Japan (where he is known as Jion Daishi) and translated Buddhist scripture. He was the most accomplished of the disciples of Xuanzang (602–664), whose portrait is displayed in this exhibition. Portraits of venerated monks were hung in temples and connected followers to a heritage of rigorous thought and exemplary deeds. Religious genealogy reinforced the legitimacy of the institutions. The same ideology informed the arts in Japan. This scroll is an adaptation of a seated portrait used in the Jion-e memorial rites at Yakushiji temple in Nara. The archaic line style, derived from Tang dynasty conventions, enhances the intensity of the figure. The combination of monumentality and humanity is a classic expression of religious portraiture, in which conveying character is more important than achieving a physical likeness.	慈恩大師像 Title: Portrait of Jion Daishi (Guiji) Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 59 1/4 x 30 1/4 in.

44849.jpg	“Universal Gateway,” Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra	Calligrapher: Sugawara Mitsushige	Japanese	dated 1257	This scroll, with thirty-four images from the Lotus Sutra’s “Universal Gateway of the Bodhisattva Perceiver of the World’s Sounds,” is the earliest known painted version, in one handscroll, of this litany praising the manifold mercies of the bodhisattva Kannon (Sanskrit: Avalokiteshvara). This chapter with illustrations, singled out for special worship, was popular in China as early as the Tang dynasty. A Song-dynasty printed version reached Japan by the thirteenth century.According to the calligrapher’s inscription, this scroll, made in 1257, was modeled after a Song printed book of 1208, which in turn was based on a painted scroll. No Chinese model for this scroll has been discovered, but many similar printed versions from later periods are preserved in China and Japan. The anonymous artist who transformed the Chinese original into a painted handscroll inventively incorporated indigenous yamato-e elements, especially in the landscapes.	『妙法蓮華経』「観世音菩薩普門品」 Title: “Universal Gateway,” Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra Artist: Calligrapher: Sugawara Mitsushige (Japanese, active mid- 13th century) Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: dated 1257 Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; ink, color, and gold on paper Dimensions: Overall with mounting: 9 11/16 in. × 30 ft. 8 1/16 in.

39669.jpg	Taima Mandala		Japan	14th century	The Taima Mandala represents the Pure Land of Amida Buddha and is bordered on three sides by parables from the Sutra on the Meditation on the Buddha of Infinite Life (Kanmuryō jukyō). This text recounts the promise at the core of Pure Land School teaching: that those who concentrate on the Buddha Amida, and recite his name will be escorted to his blissful paradise at the moment of death. The painting depicts an enormous palace with a golden pond presided over by Amida and his retinue. Musicians, dancers, and thirty-seven types of celestial beings fill the skies and pavilions. Those born into the Pure Land emerge from lotus buds in the water. The parables tell the story of Queen Vaidehi, who achieved birth there by performing sixteen meditations presented to her by Amida. The scenes along the bottom represent the nine levels of birth. This type of mandala was introduced to Japan from China in the 700s along with teachings about Amida’s Pure Land.	当麻曼荼羅図 Title: Taima Mandala Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 36 1/8 x 28 5/8 in.

44910.jpg	The Wisdom King Aizen (Aizen Myōō)		Japan	14th century	Aizen Myōō is a wrathful deity, as suggested by his fearsome expression, his red skin, the bow and arrow he holds in two of his six hands, and the roaring lion’s head he wears as a crown. Aizen—the two characters of whose name mean, literally, “dyed in love”—is, in fact, a force for good in Esoteric Buddhism. Practitioners pray to him to transform human desires, especially sexual ones, into powerful spiritual energy that, through ritual, can be harnessed to help them escape suffering. Backed by a variegated halo within an orb of red flames, the deity sits atop a multitiered lotus pedestal that hovers above delicately swirling gold clouds and is decorated with an image of dragons emerging over a rough sea. Aizen is surrounded by a proliferation of red, blue, green, and white wish-fulfilling jewels (hōju), a sign of this deity’s devotion to the needs of the faithful.	愛染明王像 Title: The Wisdom King Aizen (Aizen Myōō) Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, gold, and cut gold leaf (kirikane) on silk Dimensions: Image: 53 × 32 1/4 in.

44984.jpg	Descent of Eleven-Headed Kannon		Japan	14th century	The bodhisattva Kannon is closely associated with the Buddha of Infinite Light, Amida Nyorai, who vowed to save all sentient beings by bringing them to his Pure Land in the West. This role is indicated in the iconography of his adornment. The crown and rays of light that emanate in all directions from his golden form recall Kannon’s role as the principal attendant to the Amida Buddha (Sanskrit: Amitābha) in visions of descent (raigō). Here, the bodhisattva comes alone to meet the believer, appearing on a cloud as though traveling in haste from his paradise in the southern ocean, called Mount Fudaraku (Sanskrit: Potalaka). His right hand, open to bestow compassion, is encircled by crystal prayer beads, and his left holds a lotus in a vase, representing the healing power of Buddhist law. Eleven diminutive heads atop his own signal the manifold ways he appears to hear, observe, and meet every need. The haloed topmost head is that of Amida.	十一面観音来迎図 Title: Descent of Eleven-Headed Kannon Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, gold, and cut-out gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 33 15/16 x 15 1/4 in.

44845.jpg	Scroll of Deities of the Diamond World Mandala		Japan	dated 1083	This iconographic handscroll features representations of the thirty-seven principal Buddhist deities from the Diamond World Mandala, along with auxiliary deities, amounting to a total of forty-nine deities. According to an inscription, it was copied from a scroll belonging to the temple Zentō-in on Mount Hiei in Shiga prefecture. Zentō-in, in fact, possesses a scroll very similar to this one. Known as the Scroll of the Thirty-Seven Deities, the Zentō-in scroll was brought to Japan from China by the founder of the Tendai School, Saichō (767–822), in 806. Distinct from the Diamond World Mandala of Kūkai's (774–835) Shingon School (see example), in which bodhisattvas are shown sitting on lotus thrones, this Tendai School scroll depicts bodhisattvas riding animals and birds. The identities of some of the deities in the scroll are indicated with Sanskrit letters, while the attributes held by others are noted with Chinese characters. Scrolls such as this one were often copied by initiates into Esoteric Buddhism as a means of instruction, but the fine line work of this scroll indicates that it was brushed by a professional artist. It may have been used as a model for the production of hanging-scroll format painted mandalas.	金剛界曼荼羅諸尊図像 Title: Scroll of Deities of the Diamond World Mandala Period: Heian period (794–1185) Date: dated 1083 Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 11 3/4 in. x 17 ft. 9 1/4 in.

44911.jpg	Iconographic Drawings of the Five Kings of Wisdom (Myōō-bu shoson)		Japan	12th century	The Five Great Kings of Wisdom (Godai Myōō) are ferocious-looking deities who ward off evil in order to protect the Buddha’s law. The opening section of this scroll shows various depictions of Fudō Myōō, the Immovable King of Wisdom. The surrounding mandorla of flames represents the extinguishing of human passions. Accompanying the illustrations are schematic drawings of the deity’s attributes: a vajra “thunderbolt” sword (a symbol for cutting through ignorance), an eight-spoked dharmachakra disk, and a two-pronged vajra with rope. The Zuzō shō (or Jikkanshō) is an encyclopedia of Esoteric Buddhist iconography in ten scrolls, with detailed descriptions of the attributes of the various Myōō. This scroll is stylistically close to the oldest surviving version of the Zuzō shō, housed at Daigoji Temple in Kyoto from approximately 1193.	『図像抄』〈十巻抄〉明王部諸尊 Title: Iconographic Drawings of the Five Kings of Wisdom (Myōō-bu shoson) Period: Heian period (794–1185) Date: 12th century Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 13 1/4 in. x 42 ft. 2 3/16 in.

It comes from a book of iconographic drawings representing the vast array of Buddhas and bodhisattvas depicted in the Diamond World (Kongōkai) and Womb World (Taizōkai) Mandalas. His primary name is inscribed in the upper right and his “secret name,” Kiyohara Kongō, in the upper left. The deity’s “seed syllables” (shuji), tiny Sanskrit characters that signify his nature and function, appear at the bottom right along with Chinese characters to aid in their pronunciation and interpretation.

39933.jpg	Iconographic Drawing of a Rainmaking Mandala		Japan	12th century	This unusual mandala, a sketch from a compendium of esoteric Buddhist images, set in the watery world of dragon kings, was used in rites to end drought. Interestingly, there are no known polychrome or highly finished versions of this type of mandala, though they are recorded as having been used in sutra-reading services performed by monks from the Tōji and Daigoji temples in Kyoto as early as the ninth century. Perhaps these diagrams were made each time an extraordinary plea for rain was required. The transcendent repose of the bodhisattva Monju (Sanskrit: Manjushri), seated on a garuda bird and cloud at the center, is particularly striking amid the serpents and swirls of water that surround him. The text from which this visualization is drawn is known in Japanese as the Daiunrinshōukyō.	請雨経曼荼羅図像 Title: Iconographic Drawing of a Rainmaking Mandala Period: Heian period (794–1185) Date: 12th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 23 3/8 × 20 3/8 in.

45619.jpg	Iconographic Drawing of the Bodhisattva Memyō (Ashvaghosha)		Japan	12th century	This iconographic drawing represents Memyo Bosatsu, a deity of sericulture who provides the poor with clothes. The bodhisattva is thought to have originally been a deity indigenous to Chinese popular cults that was incorporated into Esoteric Buddhist iconography. Atop a lotus pedestal on a white horse, which in turn hovers on clouds, the bodhisattva faces leftward. Multiple arms hold such attributes as a reel, a bunch of thread, and a beam balance, while his hands are folded in a worshipping gesture. Usually he is accompanied by three female attendants bearing offerings associated with sericulture, but this painting illustrates only male figures. Moreover, some differences from the general iconographical features of Memyo Bosatsu, such as the hands in a gesture of worship and the full lotus position of the legs, make this a somewhat rare representation. The tight composition of the figures, shaded in red, the flying clouds, as well as the vividness and strength of the brushwork suggest not an iconographical exercise by a monk but a preliminary Buddhist painting made by a professional artist.	馬鳴菩薩図像 Title: Iconographic Drawing of the Bodhisattva Memyō (Ashvaghosha) Period: Heian period (794–1185) Date: 12th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Overall: 46 1/4 x 16 1/2 in.

Kongōyasha Myōō is presented with three faces, five eyes, and six arms, with each hand holding one of his attributes: a wheel, an arrow, a bow, a sword, a tri-pronged vajra, and a vajra bell. Introduced from China by Kobo Daishi (774-836), a founder of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism, the Five Great Guardian Kings became an important ritual icon, called upon as protectors of the nation during the Ninnōkyō ceremony (Sutra of the Benevolent Kings), which was performed on special occasions	金剛夜叉明王 Title: Kongōyasha Myōō Period: Heian period (794–1185) Date: 12th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 28 3/8 x 21 1/4 in.

In four hands he holds a trident, a wheel, a sword, and a jeweled club, while he joins his other two hands with both middle fingers extended, in the mudra of restraint (konpon-in). Painted images of Wisdom Kings like Daiitoku were used in rituals to protect society from harm.

45622.jpg	Anchira-taisho Jochi		Japan	1164	The subject of this iconographic drawing, which originally belonged to Kōzanji, a temple in the mountains northwest of Kyoto, is generally identified as General Anchira (Andira in Sanskrit), one of the twelve guardian generals who dedicated themselves to the Yakushi (Bhaishajyaguru) Buddha. The twelve generals are usually crowned with the twelve animals of the zodiac; here, Anchira has a rabbit on his head.The drawing was executed with exceptional care. According to a document accompanying the scroll, it was copied by Jōchi from a Chinese model in 1164. Inscriptions in the painting indicate specific colors iconographically associated with this deity.	安底羅大将図像(付.裏書) Title: Anchira-taisho Jochi Period: Heian period (794–1185) Date: 1164 Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink on paper Dimensions: Image (a): 21 7/8 x 12 5/8 in.

45617.jpg	Iconographic Drawing of Saturn		Japan	12th century	Rituals dedicated to the stars and planets were introduced to Japan from China in the ninth century together with Esoteric Buddhist teachings. Doyō (Sanskrit: Shanaishchara), or the planet Saturn, is one of the Nine Luminaries (Sanskrit: Navagraha) of the stellar system as originally defined in early Indian texts that were later incorporated into Buddhism. In China, Buddhist understandings of the heavens were intertwined with Daoist beliefs. Here, the planet is illustrated as an old man with a bull’s head atop his own, dressed in a flowing robe. Now mounted as a hanging scroll, the iconographic drawing once formed part of a handscroll including representations of other celestial bodies.	土曜図像 Title: Iconographic Drawing of Saturn Period: Heian period (794–1185) Date: 12th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 21 5/8 x 11 1/8 in.

40137.jpg	Mandala of the Bodhisattva Monju (Manjushri) of the Eight Syllables		Japan	13th century	This intricate painting served a central role in an Esoteric Buddhist ritual intended to prevent natural disasters and illness. The primary deity, the bodhisattva Monju (Manjushri in Sanskrit), appears in the middle of the central white orb. Immediately surrounding him are eight Sanskrit letters written in gold, representing the eight sounds of the incantation at the heart of this ritual as well as Monju’s eight youthful messengers. Four protective, wrathful deities known as Wisdom Kings appear just outside this most sacred sector of the mandala. The twenty-four subsidiary deities who occupy the outermost band consist of eight bodhisattvas, eight celestials (corresponding to the ordinal and cardinal directions of the compass), and their eight concubines, for a total of thirty-seven deities across three sectors of the painting.	八字文殊曼荼羅図 Title: Mandala of the Bodhisattva Monju (Manjushri) of the Eight Syllables Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 13th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, gold, and gold leaf on silk Dimensions: 52 3/4 × 42 3/8 in.

45524.jpg	White-Robed Kannon		Japan	13th century	This graceful frontal view of Kannon (Sanskrit: Pandaravasini) emphasizes the deity's dignity and compassion. It derives from Esoteric Buddhist iconography that systematically groups deities into mandalas of the two worlds: the Diamond World Mandala and the Womb World Mandala. White-robed Kannon is one of twenty-one Kannon in the Lotus Court section of the Womb World Mandala. The bodhisattva's pose, with one leg pendent, seems to be a precursor to the more relaxed pose he assumes in the monochrome ink painting of White-robed Kannon in a landscape. Here, Kannon, wearing a delicately decorated white robe and sitting on a white lotus pedestal, conforms to the feminized concept of “Mother Kannon,” an aspect of the deity that was developed further in later medieval worship. Some stiffness of line in the robes is probably the result of copying from a model. More fluid brushstrokes in the lotus petals create a sense of volume, a quality that suggests a thirteenth-century date for this work.	白衣観音図 Title: White-Robed Kannon Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 13th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 29 1/2 × 15 3/8 in.

44843.jpg	Eleven-Headed Kannon on Mount Fudaraku		Japan	13th century	The Eleven-Headed Kannon is worshipped for his ability to provide the faithful with relief from suffering. He is pictured seated atop a high, rocky outcropping dotted with springs and colorful trees in the midst of a vast sea, a setting in keeping with descriptions in Buddhist scripture of Kannon’s paradisical abode, Fudaraku (Sanskrit: Potalaka). In Japan, several mountainous locales came to be associated with Kannon and his paradise, including Mount Kasuga, in the city of Nara, and Nachi Waterfall, in the Kumano region, sites to which many pilgrims flocked to worship this compassionate deity.	十一面観音影向図 Title: Eleven-Headed Kannon on Mount Fudaraku Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 13th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 42 1/2 × 16 1/8 in.

45201.jpg	Descent and Return of Amida to Western Paradise with a Believer's Soul (Gōshō mandara)		Japan	ca. 1300	This painting of Amida (Sanskrit: Amitâbha) receiving the soul of the warrior Kumagai Naozane (1141–1208) is based on a dream recorded by the founder of the Pure Land sect, Hōnen (1133–1212). Naozane's taking of the tonsure after dutifully but ruefully killing the young Taira no Atsumori at the battle of Ichinotani during the Genpei War is one of the most affecting stories in Japanese war lore. Unique to this version of the raigō (welcoming descent) theme is the addition of the returning procession in the upper section. The sinuously curved composition of Amida's heavenly host amid the earthly and ethereal landscapes shows the complexity and beauty that Kamakura-period Buddhist painters achieved with the human form.	迎接曼荼羅図 Title: Descent and Return of Amida to Western Paradise with a Believer's Soul (Gōshō mandara) Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: ca. 1300 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 44 in. × 20 7/8 in.

45509.jpg	Amida Triad in the Form of Sacred Sanskrit Syllables		Japan	13th century	Embroidered Buddhist images were introduced to Japan from China in the sixth century. Large embroideries were prominent among icons from the sixth through the ninth century and were often hung in temple lecture halls. In the Kamakura period, practices focused on attaining birth in the Buddha Amida’s (Sanskrit: Amitābha) Western Paradise became widespread, and many small embroideries like this one were produced for individual devotional practice and deathbed ritual. In place of anthropomorphic images, the Sanskrit syllables for Amida, Kannon (Sanskrit: Avalokiteshvara), and Seishi (Sanskrit: Mahasthamaprapta) are used in this scroll. The needleworker substituted human hair for silk thread in the Sanskrit characters, a practice common in scrolls used during ceremonies following the death of a devotee, when prayers were offered for safe birth in Amida’s Pure Land. The embroidery conveniently depicts an altar set with offerings of flowers and an incense burner in the form of a lion, so one would not require an actual altar. Inscriptions at the top explain that Amida’s light illuminates the entire world, and that the recitation of his name will ensure that no one is left behind in the journey to his Pure Land.	刺繍種字阿弥陀三尊図 Title: Amida Triad in the Form of Sacred Sanskrit Syllables Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 13th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; silk embroidery, gold-wrapped thread, and human hair Dimensions: Image: 44 7/8 x 15 1/4 in.

The selection of poems from old anthologies and their arrangement into "competing" pairs is traditionally attributed to Emperor Gotoba (1180–1236), perhaps Japanese poetry's greatest patron. The Metropolitan's painting shows the sixty-first round, which pits Minamoto no Hitoshi (880–951) against the Lady Ichinomiya Kii (d. ca. 1113). The first of three poetry exchanges is recorded in a soft broad hand above a portrait of the male poet:Why is itthat love persistswhen deeply hidden, asa field overgrown in bamboo grassat midday?Ichinomiya Kii replies:The fields of bush clover at Manoare tangled and tossedin the autumn wind;for the dew that clings to its blossomsthere is no repose.The rest of this fictional exchange and the portrait of Ichinomiya Kii are on a separate hanging scroll now in a private collection in Japan. Several other segments from this version of the Jidaifudo utaawase exist, including one in the Tokyo National Museum. Simple ink portraits of famous poets paired with their most well known works were extremely popular in the Kamakura period. The portraits follow the conventions of their time: a person seated in a stylized three-quarter or profile view, with flattened robes emphasizing social ranking, and all individual expression reserved for the face. The playful figures in these scrolls are fanciful re-creations of cultural heroes and heroines, a unique group immortalized within the intimate lines of their poetry.

They are there to watch the traveling monk Ippen (1239–1289) invoke Amida Buddha through a buoyant dance accompanied by rhythmic chanting and percussive music, a practice called odori nenbutsu. Their anticipation is evident as they wait for his incantatory dance to begin. This section originally formed part of a handscroll illustrating the Biography of the Monk Ippen and His Disciple Ta’a, which describes the works of Ippen, founder of the Ji sect of Pure Land Buddhism.	一遍上人絵伝 「遊行上人縁起絵」 断簡 Title: A Nenbutsu Gathering at Ichiya, Kyoto Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: late 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Section of a handscroll mounted as a hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 12 3/4 × 17 3/4 in.

This extended section from a much longer handscroll is from a multi-scroll set that illustrates the legends of the temple and its founders. In this panoramic view of the temple complex, monks, pilgrims, and lay officials move from right to left toward the Golden Hall for the annual Great Maitreya Meeting, at which Buddhist scriptures were recited and ceremonies performed for the protection of the nation. The figures are painted in a lively style characterized by strong contours filled with light washes of color. The harmonious blend of landscape, architecture, and devotional practice in a temple setting is a hallmark of the scroll.	神於寺縁起絵巻断簡 Title: Scene from The Illustrated Legends of Jin’ōji Temple (Jin’ōji engi emaki) Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Section of a handscroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 13 1/2 x 114 1/2 in.

44852.jpg	Illustrated Biography of Hōnen (Shūikotokūden-e)		Japan	ca. 1310–20	This pivotal scene from a nine-handscroll set depicts the monk Hōnen (1133–1212), founder of the Pure Land School of Buddhism, inscribing a portrait of himself for one of his foremost disciples, Shinran (1173–1262). The young Shinran, easily recognizable by his bushy eyebrows, waits patiently as his master transcribes a passage from a sutra in which the Buddha Amida (Sanskrit: Amitābha) vows to save all those who call his name. The portrait Hōnen inscribes was made as a copy of the painting hanging in the center of the room. That painting depicts Hōnen with a lotus pedestal above his head, upon which the character for “Buddha,” from the phrase “Hail the name of Amida Buddha,” is visible. The Shūikotokuden-e, one of several illustrated biographies of Hōnen, was compiled in 1301 by Shinran’s relative Kakunyo (died 1351) in order to consolidate his position as Shinran’s rightful successor. This painting comes from an early copy of the lost original. The text portion preceding the illustration here actually belongs to another section of the same scroll, and describes Hōnen’s veneration of a portrait of Shandao. The painting associated with the text preserved here is lost.	拾遺古徳伝絵 断簡 Title: Illustrated Biography of Hōnen (Shūikotokūden-e) Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: ca. 1310–20 Culture: Japan Medium: Section of handscroll mounted as hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 16 x 14 15/16 in.

44847.jpg	Fujiwara no Kamatari as a Shinto Deity		Japan	after 1350	The court minister Fujiwara no Kamatari (614–669), was the first of his illustrious clan to dominate Japanese court life (which the family continued to do through the twelfth century). After his death, he came to be venerated as a Shinto deity at Danzan Shrine in Tonomine, near Nara. Seen here in official garb, he is attended by his sons—one a high-ranking Buddhist monk and the other Kamatari’s successor at court. Their kami nature is indicated by three hanging golden mirrors—symbolic objects in Shinto.	藤原鎌足像 Title: Fujiwara no Kamatari as a Shinto Deity Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: after 1350 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; color on silk Dimensions: Image: 34 x 15 in.

36143.jpg	White-robed Kannon		Japan	14th century	Avalokiteshvara, or Kannon in Japanese, one of the most important bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism, was traditionally venerated in Zen more as a model for the contemplative life than for his traditional role as savior. This approach is reflected in the iconographic mode most favored in Zen, the white-robed Kannon. A more human image of the deity, he relaxes here near a waterfall in a woodland setting. The inclusion of Sudhana (lower right), the archetypal pilgrim youth who sought the bodhisattva in Potalaka, his island paradise, reflects Zen assimilation of Pure Land belief.This early painting, with its skillful handling of ink in supple lines for the figure and graduated wash for the landscape, adheres closely to thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Chinese models and reveals the roots of Japanese ink painting.	白衣観音図 Title: White-robed Kannon Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on silk Dimensions: Image: 45 3/4 × 20 3/8 in.

44885.jpg	Kasuga Mandala		Japan	13th century	When the imperial court moved to Nara in the early eighth century, the Kasuga area became an important Shinto site. Here, the Kasuga Shrine and its environs are depicted in bird’s-eye perspective with Mount Mikasa, the sacred mountain, at top. Viewing this mandala could function as a virtual pilgrimage. Dedicated to the veneration of the Fujiwara clan’s tutelary kami, the Kasuga Shrine legitimized and strengthened the position of the family in politics and society.	春日宮曼荼羅図 Title: Kasuga Mandala Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 13th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 35 1/2 × 16 3/4 in.

44282.jpg	The Four Deities of Mount Kōya		Japan	late 14th century	The temple-shrine complex on Mount Kōya has served as the headquarters of the Shingon sect of Buddhism since it was established in the ninth century by Kūkai (774–835), who is credited with transmitting the teachings from China. This painting shows the four primary deities of Niutsuhime Shrine, a sacred Shinto site at the base of the mountain. They sit on platforms before trifold screens within a shrine whose entrance is guarded by a pair of lions. The site’s original deities, Niu and her male counterpart, the hunter deity Kariba, are shown at top. Below them are two female deities, Kehi and Itsukushima. At the bottom of the picture are two dogs, one black and one white, who, along with their master, Kariba, are said to have originally guided Kūkai to this remote location.	高野四所明神像 Title: The Four Deities of Mount Kōya Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: late 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 37 × 16 in.

44286.jpg	Rakan		Japan		Arhats (known in Japanese as rakan) are legendary disciples of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni. Following his example, they attained enlightenment through their own efforts. Like the disciples of Jesus, they remain in the world to preserve the teachings of the historical Buddha until the coming of the future Buddha, Maitreya. They are invariably portrayed in outdoor settings, often attended by animals both familiar and fantastic. Images of rakan hold a special place in Zen Buddhism, where they are honored as exemplars of the individual spiritual quest. They are usually envisioned in groups of sixteen, eighteen, or five hundred and are hung flanking an image of Shakyamuni. These two can be presumed to have come from a set of sixteen, the most common format. They are closely modeled on paintings (now in the Tokyo National Museum) that were signed by a Chinese professional painter, Jin Dashou, at the end of the twelfth century in Ningbo, the port in Zhejiang Province through which Chinese teachers and Japanese students of the Zen sect traveled. The Chinese mien of the figures and the garden setting are features of an iconographic tradition attributed to Li Gonglin (ca. 1040–1106), the most celebrated figure painter of the Song dynasty.

Placed within the visual framework of a Buddhist deity and attired in the clothing of a noble youth, he holds a sword with his right hand, an allusion to his Buddhist counterpart Monju (Sanskrit: Manjushri), the bodhisattva of wisdom, whose attributes include a sword with which to cut through the illusions of the unenlightened mind. Monju is often depicted as a youthful figure, a visual reflection of his purified wisdom. A wakamiya, or “young shrine,” is a type of subsidiary shrine usually dedicated to the child of a deity venerated in the shrine’s principal sanctuary and symbolizes youthfulness and rejuvenation.	春日若宮曼荼羅 Title: Mandala of Wakamiya of Kasuga Shrine (Kasuga wakamiya mandara) Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: early 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, gold, and cut gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 29 3/4 in. × 15 in.

An ancient Hindu deity, Dakini was originally a man-eating demoness transformed by the Buddha Mahavairocana (Dainichi Nyorai) into a life-engendering divinity. She embodies powers of fertility that were invoked for imperial enthronement rituals in the Kyoto court, which led to her assimilation with the ancient Shinto fox deity, Inari.	荼枳尼天像 Title: Dakini Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on hemp Dimensions: Image: 29 1/2 in. × 13 in.

53205.jpg	Mandala of the Bodhisattva Hannya (Prajnaparamita)		Japan	14th century	The bodhisattva at the center of this mandala personifies the “perfection of wisdom,” a supreme understanding of the nature of things that is fundamental to Mahayana Buddhist teachings. The mandala would have been used during sutra recitations and other rituals. The bodhisattva, holding a scripture, is attended by Bonten and Taishakuten (Sanskrit: Brahma and Indra), major Hindu deities adopted into the Buddhist pantheon as protectors of the faith.The mandala imagines a tiered space with a series of gates leading from the outside in through increasingly sacred registers. A monk near a gate at the bottom is a reminder of the material world. At the periphery are dragons, a phoenix, and apsaras playing music. Dozens of demigods in the gray register serve as protectors of the Sixteen Benevolent Deities in the green area, and the holiest sector features the central triad on a blue platform.	般若菩薩曼荼羅図 Title: Mandala of the Bodhisattva Hannya (Prajnaparamita) Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, gold, and gold foil on silk Dimensions: Image: 64 1/2 x 48 5/8 in.

73370.jpg	Mandala of Kumano Shrine	Unidentified artist		early 14th century	Kumano mandalas represent the Kumano Shrine complex, one of the most sacred sites in Japan. The painting is divided into three sections. At center, Buddhas and bodhisattvas sit on the tiled floor of a temple. In the bottom register, Shinto deities appear against mountains that dip into the Pacific Ocean. The top register reflects the distinctive confluence of Shinto and Buddhism that took place in medieval Japan, depicting deities from both religious traditions standing side by side. At right is Nachi Waterfall, the largest waterfall in Japan, whose tutelary deity—the one-thousand-armed Kannon—is shown in shining gold. Standing against the tallest peak is the three-eyed, blue-bodied Zaō Gongen, the tutelary deity of yamabushi (mountain-dwelling practitioners of a sect known as Shugendō). The sect's legendary founder, En no Gyōja, can be seen seated in a nearby cave, flanked by his two servant-demons.	熊野曼茶羅図 Title: Mandala of Kumano Shrine Artist: Unidentified artist Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: early 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 51 15/16 x 22 13/16 in.

Shun’oku’s illustrious monastic career included top administrative positions, abbotships at major monastery temples, including Tenryūji and Nanzenji in Kyoto, and close relationships with the first and third Ashikaga shoguns. Zen portraits called chinsō were disseminated among followers and served a ritual function in memorial services. The bamboo staff signifies authority, and Shun’oku’s decorative robes and kesa (monk’s vestment) are important signs of rank. Shun’oku inscribed his portrait with a poem: There are no eyes atop the head. There are eyebrows below the chin. This is everything; this is nothing.I also could not become a phoenix.

75297.jpg	Shaka (Shakyamuni), the Historical Buddha, with Two Attendant Bodhisattvas and the Ten Great Disciples		Japan	early 14th century	At the center of this richly painted icon is the historical Buddha, Shaka (Shakyamuni in Sanskrit). He is flanked by his attendants, Monju and Fugen, who, respectively, ride a blue lion and white elephant and represent Buddhist wisdom and practice. This holy trio is accompanied by the ten major disciples.Rendered in fine pigments and gold on silk, this workis a testament to the influence of Chinese Buddhist painting of the Song dynasty (960–1279) on medieval Japanese Buddhist painting. The anonymous artist probably modeled his work after an example imported from China.	釈迦三尊十大弟子像 Title: Shaka (Shakyamuni), the Historical Buddha, with Two Attendant Bodhisattvas and the Ten Great Disciples Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: early 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 42 x 22 1/8 in.

At center, Shaka sits atop a lotus pedestal, flanked by attendant bodhisattvas, Fugen and Monju. Their radiant bodies are meticulously described using a combination of gold paint and strips of cut gold foil, a technique called kirikane. They are surrounded by a diverse group of benevolent deities charged with protecting the Sutra itself and all those who recite it.The lengthy Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra was translated from Sanskrit into Chinese by the prolific translator Xuanzang (602–664), who appears at bottom right carrying a scroll and brush, and wearing a portable chest containing scriptures. The fierce red deity opposite him is the Great General of the Desert (Jinja Daishō), who is said to have protected Xuanzang during his travels.	釈迦三尊十六善神像 Title: Shaka (Shakyamuni), the Historical Buddha, with Two Attendant Bodhisattvas and Sixteen Benevolent Deities Artist: Unidentified artist Japanese Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: late 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, gold, and cut gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 55 x 26 in.

77814.jpg	The Illustrated Sutra of Past and Present Karma (Kako genzai inga kyō emaki)	Unidentified artist		late 13th century	Highly Sinicized figures meant to represent the Buddha’s father and his men occupy a landscape with a soft rolling hill and trees in a restrained color palette. Beneath the illustration, the scripture is executed in an attractive standard script (kaisho). The calligraphy relates how prince Siddhartha (the historical Buddha), having left the palace, travels to Mount Gaya, where his uncle lives, and practices asceticism for six years. The king dispatches ministers to report on his son’s activities and orders that he be brought one thousand cartfuls of daily necessities and watched over at all times.This work is a section of one version of The Illustrated Sutra of Past and Present Karma (Kako genzai inga kyō emaki), a Buddhist scripture whose title is often colloquialized to The Illustrated Sutra of Cause and Effect (E-inga kyō). The first narrative known to have been painted in Japan, it details the lives, past and present, of the historical Buddha. The earliest examples of this work in Japan, which date to the eighth century, are thought to be copies of now lost Chinese originals from the Tang dynasty (618–907), or possibly even the Sui dynasty (581–618).	『過去現在絵因果経』 断簡 (松永本) Title: The Illustrated Sutra of Past and Present Karma (Kako genzai inga kyō emaki) Artist: Unidentified artist Japanese, active late 13th century Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: late 13th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 10 7/8 x 22 3/8 in.

The dreamer records a meeting with two of his acquaintances, one of whom turned out to be a deity of the Kasuga Shrine in Nara. The dream was once part of a handscroll recounting all the dreams recollected by the Buddhist monk Myōe, a seminal figure in the revival of the teachings of the Flower Garland Sutra (Kegonkyō). Myōe was further renowned for his extraordinary predilection for seeing visions and for dreaming, which he dutifully recorded from the 1190s until his death in 1232. These writings are now collectively known as the Dream Record Yume no ki).The drawing of three mountains in the distance refers to the three peaks at Kasuga, while the hills in the foreground represent the forested hills of Myōe’s own domicile at Kōzanji temple.	『夢記』 断簡 Title: Section of the Dream Diary with a Sketch of Mountains Artist: Myōe Kōben 明恵高弁 (Japanese, 1173–1232) Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: ca. 1203–10 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 12 x 19 in.

53660.jpg	Ten Verses on Oxherding		Japan	1278	Since the early history of the Chan (Zen) tradition in China, a herdboy’s search for his lost ox has served as a parable for a practitioner’s pursuit of enlightenment. In the twelfth century, the Chan master Kuoan Shiyuan codified the tale into ten verses describing the phases of spiritual progress. Dated by an inscription to 1278, the present scroll is the earliest known Japanese illustrated version of these verses and the only extant copy with color illustrations. By Kuoan’s second-to-last verse, the herdboy has transcended this world; thus he and his ox are absent from the landscape. In the final stage representing the attainment of Buddhist enlightenment, the boy becomes one with Budai (Japanese: Hotei), the manifestation of the future Buddha Miroku (Sanskrit: Maitreya).	十牛頌図巻 Title: Ten Verses on Oxherding Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: 1278 Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 12 1/4 in. × 20 ft. 6 in.

In this scene, once part of a set of handscrolls painted in the hakubyō (white-drawing) style of narrative illustration, the shamaness Tajihi no Ayako receives a premonition in the form of possession by Michizane’s angry spirit. Instructed to worship the deceased statesman as a god, the disheveled, partially unclothed Tajihi no Ayako here performs an ecstatic dance on the veranda of a building while a male courtier and a monk look on. According to legend, Tajihi no Ayako received the oracle in 942 and began worshipping Tenjin. Several years later the delivery of another oracle led to the construction of the shrine proper.	北野天神縁起絵巻 断簡 「多治比文子」 Title: Possession of the Shamaness Tajihi no Ayako by the Spirit of Sugawara no Michizane, from Illustrated Legends of the Kitano Tenjin Shrine Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: ca. 1300 Culture: Japan Medium: Section of handscroll mounted as hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 11 3/16 × 21 15/16 in.

53194.jpg	The Tale of Sumiyoshi		Japan	late 13th century	The Tale of Sumiyoshi is a tenth-century story of a motherless girl who overcomes her conniving stepmother’s abuse. A dashing courtier falls in love with the young woman, but the stepmother fools him into marrying one of her own daughters instead. The girl flees to Sumiyoshi, where she finds protection with her mother’s former nurse. Through the benevolent intervention of the bodhisattva Kannon of Hasedera Temple, the courtier finds her. This scene shows him taking her back to the capital, where they will live happily ever after. Plotlines, character types, and settings from romantic narratives such as this served as inspiration to the court lady Murasaki Shikibu when she wrote the renowned Tale of Genji, roughly a century after the Tale of Sumiyoshi was composed.b) Only a few precious sections of original text that accompanied the illustrations of this handscroll survive. The text related to this example reads: “Then they arrived in the capital and went up to the mansion of Chūjō’s father, who was upset about his son’s secret marriage to an unknown country girl. Nevertheless, he built a special wing of the house for them and there established the newlyweds.”	住吉物語絵巻 詞書断簡 Title: The Tale of Sumiyoshi Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: late 13th century Culture: Japan Medium: a) Painting section from a handscroll mounted as a hanging scroll; ink and color on paperb) Calligraphy from handscroll section mounted as a hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image (a): 11 3/4 × 28 1/16 in.

53197.jpg	The Poets Henjō and Jichin, from Stylus-Illustrated Competition of Poets of Different Periods (Mokuhitsu jidai fudō uta awase-e)	Unidentified artist		mid-14th century	A popular pastime among courtiers of ancient Japan was the poetry contest, or uta-awase, which were often recorded for posterity. During the early medieval period, handscrolls illustrating imaginary competitions among various authors, not all of whom had lived at the same time (as seen here), were also created. In this handscroll section, both competitors are Buddhist monks, each represented by three waka (31-syllable court poems). The figures were drawn with a mokuhitsu, a flat wood “stylus” that makes fine, parallel lines with one stroke. The poems are inscribed above in an unusual style that combines orthodox kana (phonetic writing) with man’yōgana, the first Japanese writing system, in which Chinese characters were used to represent Japanese sounds. The poems thus visually resemble Chinese texts rather than the flowing forms usually expected for waka.	遍昭 慈鎭 木筆時代不同歌合絵 Title: The Poets Henjō and Jichin, from Stylus-Illustrated Competition of Poets of Different Periods (Mokuhitsu jidai fudō uta awase-e) Artist: Unidentified artist Period: Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: mid-14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Fragment of a handscroll, mounted as a hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 12 5/16 in. × 21 in.

This style of sutra transcription was popular from the twelfth through the fourteenth century, when wealthy patrons commissioned richly executed sutra scrolls such as this as offerings to temples, in the hope of gaining spiritual merit. It was a commonly held belief that the copying of sacred texts improved one’s chance to achieve salvation, and patrons supplied artists with expensive and valuable materials with which to work, in lieu of copying the texts themselves. Once they had been dedicated to a temple, scrolls of this quality were stored in sutra repositories and rarely used; hence their survival in good condition.	紺紙金字仏説 阿弥陀経 Title: Section of The Amitabha Sutra Artist: Unidentified Artist Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: mid-13th century Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; gold and silver on indigo paper Dimensions: Image: 8 1/16 × 83 7/16 in.

829379.jpg	Herdboys and Buffalos	Attributed to Kaō	Japanese	14th century	A pair of water buffalos, followed by a calf, wade through shallow water, their herdboys perched upon their backs. They are likely returning home after a day in the rice paddies, where, in China, water buffalos were used as draught animals, to draw ploughs that reduced the soil to a muddy consistency. The theme of herdboys and their buffalos or oxen was popular in China from the Song dynasty (960–1279) on, and was brought to Japan around the early fourteenth century, where it became a popular subject for Zen ink painters. Associated in China with agriculture, fertility, and the spring season, herdboys and buffalos were also the subject of Zen parables comparing the herding of an ox with the individual’s search for enlightenment. In this composition, the artist appears to have been influenced by the more nature-related of the two traditions.Kaō, one of the first Japanese artists to successfully assimilate the painting methods of Chinese ink painters, was a Zen Buddhist priest-painter. In many respects his work exemplifies early Japanese ink painting of the fourteenth and early fifteenth century, characterized by rapid, spontaneous brushwork, the use of wash to define form, and a minimum of detail.	伝可翁筆 牧童図 Title: Herdboys and Buffalos Artist: Attributed to Kaō (Japanese,active first half 14th century) Period: Kamakura (1185–1333)–Nanbokuchō period (1336–1392) Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 19 11/16 × 11 5/8 in.

78283.jpg	Star Mandala		Japan	13th–14th century	An understanding of the impact of celestial bodies on human activity was crucial to early East Asian Esoteric Buddhism; by the tenth century, complex star mandalas unique to Japan were being devised and used in rites for the prevention of natural calamities and epidemics as well as for the prolonging of life.Five concentric circles and an external ring of figures form this star mandala. The Buddha Shakyamuni of the Golden Wheel occupies the central circle, while the disks in the second circle represent the Big Dipper. The third and fourth circles contain the Nine Luminaries (including Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, Mercury, the sun, and the moon) as well as the lunar nodes (Ragō and Ketō) and the twelve zodiac symbols. In the fifth circle are the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions, the constellations through which the moon travels. Furthermore, the Thirty-Six Calendric Animals are paired with the Thirty-Six Celestial Guardians.	星曼荼羅図 (Hoshi mandara zu) Title: Star Mandala Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333)–Nanbokuchō period (1336–92) Date: 13th–14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, gold, and cut gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 50 1/2 × 46 1/4 in.

845123.jpg	Letter in Kana Characters	Myōe Kōben 明恵高弁	Japanese	early 13th century, probably 1220s	Monk Myōe came of age at the outset of the Kamakura period, a time when Japan’s political and religious structures were undergoing transformational change—when a court-centered government was shifting to a military one, and new sects of Buddhism led by charismatic leaders would emerge from the Pure Land Buddhism that flourished during the Heian period. Monk Myōe emerged as one of these spiritual leaders and was a dedicated diarist and correspondent, and more than twenty letters in his hand survive, including the one here. Some, quite lengthy, provide revealing insights into his thoughts, relationships, and circumstances. Other brief notes, such as here are difficult to interpret without more context. Since this letter has not previously been published or scrutinized by Myōe scholars, and is considered a new discovery, further research remains to be carried out on its contents. During the early Kamakura period, when Myōe was active, the Hosshōji style (Hosshōji-ryū 法性寺流) of calligraphy flourished among both court nobles and the warrior elite. This style was bold and sometimes even brash compared with elegant, graceful style associated with the handwriting of court nobles in the Heian period. At the same time, bokuseki 墨跡, the brusque, idiosyncratic calligraphy of monks, mainly of the Rinzai sect, came to be prized, both for its rule-breaking individuality, but also due to association with the personalities of famous prelates. Similarly the distinctive brush writing of spiritual leaders of other Buddhist sects such as Shinran (the founder of the Pure Land offshoot Jōdo Shinshū) and Nichiren was cherished, and Myōe’s calligraphy was similarly sought after and preserved as autograph traces of an inspiring religious personality.Myōe, scion of a samurai family in the Heike lineage, was born in Arita, Kishū province (Wakayama prefecture). At age nine, he lost both parents and was placed in the care of his uncle, Monk Jōkaku上覚of Jingoji Temple on Mount Takao, Kyoto, and began Buddhist training under his uncle. He became an adherent of the Kegon sect at Tōdaiji in Nara and rose quickly in the monastic ranks. Also known by his Buddhist name Kōben 高弁, he went on to found of Kōzanji Temple in Togano’o, Kyoto. Retired Emperor Go-Toba, Kenreimon-in (Taira no Tokuko), Kujō Kanezane, Hōjō Yasutoki and many other powerful political figures of the day embraced his teachings. He also achieved esteem as a waka poet and calligrapher. He is best remembered for his Dream Diary Diary (Yume no ki 夢記), a personal journal he maintained for almost forty years, represented by two sections in The Met’s collection (2014.719.3 and 2014.719.4).

845124.jpg	Kana Letter on Stamped Images of Amida Buddha		Japan	early 13th century	Brushed in elegant cursive characters, mostly in kana (Japanese phonetic writing), this treasured letter of Monk Jōgyō has in recent years been sumptuously remounted as a hanging scroll. Jōgyō, as the third son of first Kamakura Shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147–1199), was born into the most powerful military family of the day, but he eschewed the political infighting between the palace in Kyoto and shogunate in eastern Japan, and took Buddhist vows at an early age. He trained at Ninnaji in Kyoto and rose in monastic ranks to become an important Shingon prelate. To have rare example of thirteenth-century calligraphy of an esteemed religious figure is worthy of preservation and display in and of itself. Yet, the viewer immediately understands that something more complex is at work here, since printed images of Amida show through from the reverse side, creating an intriguing visual dialectic of the transcendental realm of the Buddhas and the secular world represented by an informal communication in the vernacular (not a Buddhist treatise or sutra). Such printed sheets are usually called “stamped Buddhas” (inbutsu 印佛), though sometimes the term “printed Buddhas” (suribotoke 摺仏, also pronounced or shūbutsu) is used, though that term is properly reserved for when the sheet of paper is placed on top of the ink block. Sometimes large prints with a hundred or more were created; for instance see the example from the Cowles Collection comprising one hundred images of Fudō Myōō, created by stamping the same block to create ten rows.This letter belongs to a cache of personal letters, sutras, other religious documents and objects that were placed inside statues of the Amida Triad, created in the Kamakura period, at Gobōjakujō’in subtemple at Kōyasan, the headquarters of the Shingon sect. When the sculptures were being examined in the 1910s, many similar letters and documents were discovered, including a scroll of Shingon dharani (Esoteric Buddhist magical texts), which was designated an Important Cultural Property. It was a well established practice to place objects related to the patrons who funded a Buddhist statue or objects related to deceased monks and members of the temple community inside of temple statues, collectively referred to as “offerings for interring in statues” (zōnai nōnyūhin 像内納入品). It was at that time of the investigation of the Kōyasan statues that it was realized that this letter and several others came from this same cache but must have been removed earlier on and sold to collectors in Japan. Other known examples, in the collections of the late Sylvan Barnet and William Burto, Hiroshi Sugimoto, and private collection in Japan (e.g., fig. 2) have either printed Buddhas, as here, or Buddhist texts in Chinese, and in some cases dharani (magical formulae) in Sanskrit. For the letters and documents associated with Jōgyō it is believed that the images or texts were either printed or inscribed on the reverse side of Jōgyō letters after he died, in order to create karmic merit for the deceased soul.	仮名消息・印仏 Title: Kana Letter on Stamped Images of Amida Buddha Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: early 13th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; brush written letter, ink on paper (front); stamped images, ink on paper (reverse) Dimensions: Image: 10 5/8 × 16 1/2 in.

A wrathful avatar of Dainichi (Sanskrit: Vairocana), the Buddha of the Cosmos, Fudō vanquishes any evil that threatens to impede the Buddhist teachings. The anonymous artist illustrates the deity’s ferocity with wide and wild eyes, erect standing posture and towering size, and his flaming mandorla. He is flanked by his two attendants Seitaka and Kongara (Sanskrit: Cetaka and Kimkara), whose smaller size indicates their subsidiary role. The pale Seitaka gazes up at Fudō while the red skinned Kongara leans on a golden staff with his eyes cast down and a deep frown on his face. They wear matching attire of a reddish orange skirt with a green border and matching sash, all detailed in gold.	不動明王像 Title: Fudō Myōō (Achala Vidyaraja), The Immovable Wisdom King Artist: Unidentified Artist Period: Kamakura period (1185–1333) Date: mid-13th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 29 15/16 × 13 7/8 in.

Pictures of celebrated horses appear individually or in groups on a variety of Japanese painting formats, from scrolls to large-scale works on folding screens and panels, and were held in particularly high regard. Folding screens featuring images of horses, for example, served as a backdrop for the enthroned emperor when he viewed equestrian activities. During the Heian period, paintings of horses that are recorded as having decorated screens used in select rooms of the imperial residence were thought to hold special power and were even rumored to come to life at night.	駿馬図 (断簡) Title: Horse and Groom Artist: Unidentified Artist Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 13 3/16 × 18 3/4 in.

Paintings like this one, worshipped in Pure Land temples, show Amida, at center in gold, and his celestial attendants descending from the heavens to deliver salvation to a believer. They descend on a bank of colorful clouds, led by two bodhisattvas—Kannon, at lower left, who extends a lotus pedestal to the devotee, and Fugen, who holds his hands in prayer. Like many early Buddhist devotional paintings, this one has suffered extensive damage through centuries of use. The acts of preserving and preparing sacred Buddhist images are considered meritorious. The work was repaired several times by patching surface losses and repainting parts, retaining its legibility and integrity as an image of worship.	阿弥陀聖衆来迎図 Title: Welcoming Descent of Amida, the Buddha of Infinite Light, and His Holy Retinue Artist: Unidentified artist , Japanese Period: Kamakura (1185–1333)–Nanbokuchō (1336–92) period Date: 14th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, gold, and cut gold leaf (kirikane) on silk Dimensions: Image: 52 1/4 × 23 1/2 in.

The palace architecture, a Taihu rock, blossoming cherry and pear trees, and Chinese roses enrich the sense of exotic palace life. The meticulous brushwork of the draperies and the solid texture of the rock indicate a Kano painter of the Momoyama period, one who might have worked closely with Mitsunobu, the eldest son of the great master Kano Eitoku.

Chinese paintings, treasured by Ashikaga shoguns of the fifteenth century, exerted a strong influence on Japanese artists of the Muromachi period, when Chinese culture also served as a model for the Zen priesthood and educated elite. Little is known about the artist, but a good number of academic-style bird-and-flower paintings feature his seal or have been attributed to his hand.	元賀筆 ガマズミ属に山鵲図 Title: Magpie on Viburnum Branch Artist: Genga (Japanese, active early 16th century) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: early 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 18 1/4 in. × 14 in.

45628.jpg	Portrait of Jianzhen		Japan	15th century	Although the subject of this portrait of a seated Buddhist priest is not recorded, the image's similarity to earlier works makes him identifiable as the Chinese priest Jianzhen (688–763), an important figure in the early history of Buddhism in Japan. Jianzhen, who was blind, hailed from the city of Yangzhou, a major cosmopolitan center and economic powerhouse in Tang-dynasty China. After receiving early training at the temple Dayunsi in Yangzhou, he moved to the Tang capital, Chang'an (now Xi'an), and later to Luoyang, before returning home to Yangzhou where in 742 he received an invitation from two Japanese priests to visit the Japanese capital at Nara. He spent the next decade trying and failing multiple times to make the journey to Japan, where he is known as Ganjin, before successfully arriving in Kyūshū and later Nara in 753. Later that decade he established the temple Tōshōdaiji in Nara and made it the headquarters of the newly established Ritsu sect. This portrait adheres closely to a famous eighth-century dry lacquer sculpture of Jianzhen installed at Tōshōdaiji that is the earliest extant example in Japan of a portrait sculpture and a designated National Treasure. Here Jianzhen is shown seated in meditation on a platform before a trifold screen bearing anachronistic ink paintings of landscapes and geese on a sandbar, typical not of the eighth century but of the Muromachi period, when this portrait was created.	鑑真像 (Ganjin zō) Title: Portrait of Jianzhen Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: 35 x 15 1/4 in.

His right hand is open to bestow compassion and encircled by crystal prayer beads, while his left hand holds a lotus in a vase, representing the healing power of the Buddhist Law. The haloed topmost head is that of Amida, the Buddha of Infinite Light.

45245.jpg	Hōtei Pointing to the Moon	Attributed to Shinno Noami		15th century	"Big Belly" or "Cloth Bag" Budai, known as Hōtei in Japan, was a tenth-century monk who wandered around Siming (modern Ningbo) in China with his walking staff, begging for alms to place in his sack. Eccentric and given to puzzling pronouncements, he was thought to be an earthly incarnation of Maitreya, the Buddha of the Future. Hōtei was a favorite subject in Zen ink painting. Easily recognizable, he personified the pure nature and intuitive experience necessary for enlightenment. Hōtei points at the cloud to teach us that truth cannot be rationally taught. A mere handful of dynamic ink lines describes Hōtei's robed body. The finer gray lines and wash are used for his face, hands, and foot, in accordance with tradition of Zen figure painting.

45206.jpg	Birds and Flowers	Attributed to Kano Yukinobu 狩野之信	Japanese	mid-16th century	The lively depiction of birds in natural settings with seasonal trees and flowers was a favorite theme in early ink painting and a hallmark of the Kano school of painters led by Kano Motonobu (ca. 1476–1559). This rendition attributed to Motonobu's brother, Yukinobu, is in the ink-wash style inspired by the Southern Song painter Muqi (late 13th–early 14th century), which uses tonal variations of ink instead of outlines to define the soft forms of feathers and flowers.	伝狩野之信筆 花鳥図 Title: Birds and Flowers Artist: Attributed to Kano Yukinobu 狩野之信 (Japanese, ca. 1513–1575) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: mid-16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Diptych of hanging scrolls; ink on paper Dimensions: 39 1/8 x 16 3/4 in.

42344.jpg	Landscape of the Four Seasons (Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers)	Sōami	Japanese	early 16th century	Sōami was the last of three generations of painters and connoisseurs (Nōami, Geiami, Sōami) who served as artistic advisers to the Ashikaga shoguns in Kyoto. Like other ink painters of his time, the artist took Chinese landscapes—often rendered on small album leaves—as inspiration for large-scale, panoramic screens and sliding doors that set a contemplative mood in the mansions and temples of the capital. These screens refer to the landscape of southern China, probably known to the artist through a handscroll prized by the Ashikaga shoguns, Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang, painted by Muqi, a thirteenth-century Chinese monk-painter.Vignettes of daily life are here unified into a monumental ink landscape showing the progression of the four seasons, beginning with misty spring at far right and ending with wintry, snow-covered rooftops at far left. In this, Sōami conformed to a long-standing preference in Japanese interior decoration for seasonal imagery, which was rooted in the art and poetry of the Heian period (794–1185).	相阿弥筆 四季山水図 （瀟湘八景） Title: Landscape of the Four Seasons (Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers) Artist: Sōami (Japanese, died 1525) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: early 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink on paper Dimensions: each: 68 1/4 in. × 12 ft. 2 in.

45417.jpg	Death of the Historical Buddha (Nehan-zu)		Japan	15th century	The Buddha’s death, when he passed from his earthly life to the final release from suffering as an enlightened being, is a confirmation of essential tenets of Buddhist faith. The people witnessing the event here reveal their own imperfect level of enlightenment through their grief. The bodhisattvas, however, enlightened buddhas-to-be who remain tethered to the earthly realm to assist people on their paths to salvation, show a solemn serenity. Except for the Bodhisattva Jizō, who appears as a monk holding a jewel near the center of the bier, these deities are envisioned in princely finery adorning their golden bodies. Shaven-headed disciples weep bitterly, as do the multi-limbed Hindu deities and guardians who have been converted to the Buddha’s teaching. Men and women of every class, joined by more than thirty animals, grieve, and even the blossoms of the sala trees change from pink to blue. Queen Maya, mother of the Buddha, descends from upper right, weeping.	仏涅槃図 Title: Death of the Historical Buddha (Nehan-zu) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 74 x 43 5/16 in.

45070.jpg	Landscape	Attributed to Kano Motonobu	Japanese	16th century	This mist-shrouded pine grove where temple rooflines are faintly visible is a set motif that signals one scene, Evening Bell from the Distant Temple, from a classic series of landscape vignettes, Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers, that developed among Chinese literati-artists in the eleventh century. It came to hold seminal importance in Japanese ink painting by the mid-fifteenth century, when no less than four versions of the subject were included among the Chinese paintings treasured by the Ashikaga shoguns. The impressionistic depiction in pale ink wash associates this depiction with the work of Muqi, a Chinese monk-painter active at the end of the thirteenth century in temples around the Southern Song capital at Hangzhou in southeast China. This poetic rendition of that landscape may have originally been part of a large composition that created an interior space on a sliding door panel or a folding screen. Its horizontal composition, however, recalls the original handscroll format of Muqi's work.

57249.jpg	Hanshan and Shide	Style of Kenkō Shōkei 賢江祥啓	Japanese	mid- to late 16th century	The eighth-century Chinese figures Hanshan and Shide (Kanzan and Jittoku, in Japanese) were Chan (Zen) Buddhist monks who held low-level positions at Guoqingsi, a temple on China’s sacred Mount Tiantai. Hanshan was a reclusive monk-poet, while Shide, his constant companion, is often shown carrying a broom, indicating his role as the temple’s custodian. This beloved pair of eccentric figures came to represent an iconoclastic aspect of Zen monastic practice and is among the most popular figural subjects in Japanese painting. This image of the monks shows them side by side, with Shide in front, hands held behind his back, while Hanshan behind him points to the sky and casts a knowing glance to his companion. Compositions like this one were derived from paintings held in Japanese collections that were believed to have been created by the Chinese Zen monk-painter Muqi 牧谿 (active ca. 1250–80). They proliferated in sixteenth-century eastern Japan, where they were frequently painted by followers of the master monk-painter Kenkō Shōkei 賢江祥啓 (active ca. 1478–ca. 1523). The present work is impressed with a seal reading Keison, a particularly prolific follower of Shōkei, but the seal has been determined to be forged.	寒山拾得図 (Kanzan Jittoku zu) Title: Hanshan and Shide Artist: Style of Kenkō Shōkei 賢江祥啓 (Japanese, active ca. 1478–ca. 1523) Date: mid- to late 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 36 1/4 × 14 1/2 in.

45639.jpg	Birds and Flowers of the Twelve Months with Chinese Calligraphy	Kano School		16th century; sheets of poetry, one dated 1553	Although traditionally it was common to paint entire scenes directly onto folding screens, alternatively, an allover design could be painted on the panels, to which small fans or albums of painting or calligraphy would then be attached. This set of screens is unusual in that the background design was painted on the screen with the knowledge that large paintings would be placed on top; that is, the screens were custom-made to accommodate these skillful bird-and-flower paintings, no doubt created by a Kano atelier artist of the late sixteenth century. Each panel of this pair of screens contains both a painted scene in a fan-shaped cartouche and a sheet of calligraphy that has been cut in half to replicate the squarish proportions of Japanese shikishi (square poem cards). The twelve scenes of birds and flowers present a progression of the characteristic flora and fauna of the four seasons. The sheets of poetry contain verses on the theme of plums in winter, which were composed and inscribed by six Chinese scholars, including Huang Yuanxu, who dated his piece to autumn 1553.	十二ヶ月花鳥図書画挿絵貼屏風 Title: Birds and Flowers of the Twelve Months with Chinese Calligraphy Artist: Kano School Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 16th century; sheets of poetry, one dated 1553 Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink and color and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 60 11/16 in. × 11 ft. 7 1/8 in.

Servants of the pantheon of Buddhist deities and equipped with supernatural powers, they increasingly became objects of religious interest during the Middle Ages in Japan. Portable shrines, or zushi as they are known in Japan, have been part of religious accoutrements from the very earliest years of Japanese Buddhism. The oldest extant example dates to the mid-seventh century and is housed in Hōryū-ji temple in Nara.

45638.jpg	Millet and Sparrows	Geiai		mid-16th century	The everyday sight of cavorting sparrows was a favored theme among painters of the Muromachi period. This deftly rendered ink painting captures their lively forms in an abbreviated manner, using so-called boneless brushwork to render their feathers without lines, in varied tones, and exploiting the white ground for their soft underbodies. The meticulous linear definition of the chrysanthemum and millet emphasizes their differing textures and allows a pleasing contrast in brushwork. A number of skilled ink paintings of birds and plants bearing “Geiai” seals survive, including a very similar composition of approximately the same size in the Mary Griggs Burke Collection. At least two versions of the “Geiai” seal are known, and some paintings have an additional seal reading “Tonshu.” Although much of Geiai’s biography remains unclear, it is thought that he worked in the capital of Kyoto, and was commissioned to paint interiors for the grand Zen temple Daitokuji.	粟に燕図 Title: Millet and Sparrows Artist: Geiai (active mid-16th century) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: mid-16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 39 9/16 × 17 5/8 in.

42342.jpg	Landscape	Maejima Sōyū	Japanese	16th century	On a moonlit night, a small boat carries its passengers toward a thatched lakeside pavilion as a bank of mist rolls through the craggy mountains. The faint traces of two seals on the lower left side of the scroll enable an attribution to Maejima Sōyū, a professional painter active in the castle-town of Odawara in eastern Japan and affiliated with a local branch of the influential Kano family of painters. Sōyū’s style owes a great deal to the family’s progenitor, Kano Masanobu (ca. 1434–ca. 1530), and he may have studied directly under Masanobu or his son, Kano Motonobu (1476–1559). A later copy in the collection of the Tokyo National Museum confirms that by the mid-nineteenth century the present work had come to bear an attribution to Masanobu. The two seals of Maejima Sōyū, which can be seen on another painting at the Met by this artist (2002.3), had already been effaced by this time, presumably to enable the attribution to his better-known teacher. The work was once part of a larger set of landscapes, probably eight or twelve scrolls total, of which five have survived and are held in various collections worldwide: the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Museum für Asiatische Kunst in Berlin, the Chiba City Museum, and a private Japanese collection.	山水図 Title: Landscape Artist: Maejima Sōyū (active mid-16th century) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 20 1/4 × 13 5/8 in.

45258.jpg	Bamboo in the Four Seasons	Attributed to Tosa Mitsunobu	Japanese	late 15th–early 16th century	The traditional Chinese subject of bamboo is given a distinctly Japanese treatment in this rendition of the four seasons. Stands of mature bamboo, leafy young bamboo plants, and tapering bamboo shoots are loosely grouped across the surface of this pair of screens, with violets and shepherd’s purse clustered near the bases of taller stalks. Beginning on the right, the seasons progress from spring to winter, although young bamboo branches, bowing as though caught in a breeze, unify the composition. The tallest bamboo plants extend upward beyond the picture plane, while the stems of younger plants are cropped by the lower border. This, along with the absence of dense clumps of foliage and the distant haze suggested by a light application of gold in the background, creates an impression of vast space. The artist appears to have mixed characteristics of different bamboo species for decorative effect.	伝土佐光信筆 四季竹図屏風 Title: Bamboo in the Four Seasons Artist: Attributed to Tosa Mitsunobu (Japanese, active ca. 1462–1525) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: late 15th–early 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel screens; ink, color, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 61 13/16 in. × 11 ft. 9 3/4 in.

45180.jpg	The Return to Court of the Four Graybeards of Mount Shang (left); Su Shi’s Visit to the Wind and Water Cave (right	In the Style of Kano Mitsunobu 狩野光信	Japanese	late 16th century	The subject of the right screen is the future Emperor Hui (reigned 194–188 B.C.) of the Han dynasty. Although the crown prince, his rightful ascendance to the throne was threatened by his father’s desire to install a son from a favored concubine. But the unprecedented return to court of four former officials who had previously abandoned their positions and secluded themselves in the countryside near Mount Shang assured Hui’s succession. Their loyalty so impressed the emperor that he withdrew his illegitimate proposal. The left screen illustrates a poem by the renowned scholar and statesman Su Shi (Su Dongpo, 1037–1101). In 1073, as Su was traveling from Hangzhou to Xincheng, he stopped at the Wind and Water Cave to meet the young poet Li Bi. After they viewed plum blossoms and composed poetry together, Su inscribed poems on the walls of the cave. In the painting, the older man crosses a footbridge accompanied by a servant, while Li awaits his arrival seated in a pavilion high above a ravine. The slender trees and the crisp, delicate outlines of the rocks are reminiscent of works by Kano Mitsunobu, son and pupil of Kano Eitoku (1543–1590).	商山四皓・蘇東坡風水洞 Title: The Return to Court of the Four Graybeards of Mount Shang (left); Su Shi’s Visit to the Wind and Water Cave (right Artist: In the Style of Kano Mitsunobu 狩野光信 (Japanese, 1565–1608) Period: Momoyama period (1573–1615) Date: late 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each screen): 68 3/4 in. x 12 ft. 4 7/8 in.

45072.jpg	Landscape	Follower of Sesson Shūkei	Japanese	16th century	This screen was originally the right half of a pair. Mountains enclose a vast lake, which presumably extended across the left screen (now missing) in a conventional landscape composition. The dynamic mountain and river landscape evokes the sixteenth-century monk-painter Sesson Shūkei, who developed an expressive style based on a highly personal interpretation of a popular Chinese subject, the Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers. The four themes embedded in the screen are (from right to left): Mountain Market in Clearing Mist, Returning Sail off Distant Shore, Autumn Moon over Lake Dongting, and Fishing Village in Evening Glow. Sesson was active in the Kantō region, which was located far from Kyoto (an established center of artistic production), and therefore developed his own distinctive style. Pasting variably sized sheets of paper onto the screen was an idiosyncrasy of his work.

45244.jpg	White-Robed Kannon		Japan	15th century	The painted dragon and tiger, animals symbolic of yin and yang in Chinese iconography, form a triptych with a serene figure of the Buddhist deity Kannon (Sanskrit: Avalokiteshvara) in a white robe. Monochrome ink paintings of Kannon were important in the religious life of the earliest Zen temples of Muromachi Japan. The bodhisattva, embodying the concept of merciful compassion, is represented here in a casual pose and natural setting that emphasize his humanity rather than his role as deified intercessor for a faithful devotee.There are many similar triptychs that combine secular subjects, such as the dragon and the tiger, with a central Buddhist image. Such triptychs were often hung in the tokonoma (alcove) of official rooms, an architectural feature suited for displaying prized Chinese-style art that developed in Japanese interiors during the fourteenth century.	白衣観音図 Title: White-Robed Kannon Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on silk Dimensions: Image: 32 7/8 in. × 71 in.

42346.jpg	Landscape with Pavilion	Kenkō Shōkei 賢江祥啓	Japanese	1478–80	A Chinese gentleman lounges against the parapet of a remote lakeside pavilion, his gaze captured by a waterfall plunging from precipitous peaks far above. The poetic inscription brushed by Tōgen Zuisen, a prominent Zen monk, ties the painted image to an ancient Chinese hermit who famously turned down a position at court in favor of spending his days fishing in isolation. Tōgen was an acquaintance of the artist, Kenkō Shōkei, a fellow Zen monk who journeyed from Kamakura to Kyoto in 1478 to study Chinese painting for three years. During that time he created this landscape, his earliest known datable work, in the style of the Chinese painter Xia Gui (active ca. 1195–1230), whose pictures he had probably only just encountered for the first time in Kyoto.The Chinese verse reads in four seven-character couplets:This world, who possesses it?Tranquil is this place, long separated from the dusty world.An endless cascade soars as if a flock of egrets,the surface of a boundless lake ripples like the scales of a fish. Skiffs float beyond treetops and thatched eaves,a screen of spired peaks stands at the clouds’ edge.

42347.jpg	Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers		Japan	16th century	A celebration of emotional responses to nature’s changing moods, the Eight Views theme was first developed in Chinese poetry and painting during the eleventh century. It was introduced to Japan in the fourteenth century, where it became a major subject of ink painting. The bustling central image of this triptych represents “Mountain Market in Clearing Mist.” At left, a blustery atmosphere pervades “Sails Returning from a Distant Shore” and “Night Rain on the Xiao and Xiang Rivers,” while at right, in “Evening Glow on the Fishing Village,” the sunset envelops a river landscape, with fishing nets left to dry by the shore. The paintings may have been part of a complete series, and demonstrate the expansion in Japan of the Chinese album-leaf composition, which was associated with the aesthetic sensibilities of the elite military class and expressions of power.	瀟湘八景図 Title: Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: One of a triptych of hanging scrolls; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 60 7/8 x 23 1/4 in.

44523.jpg	Birds and Flowers of the Four Seasons		Japan	late 16th century	This composition of flowers shown in a seasonal progression from spring to winter, paired with an auspicious motif of cranes, promotes longevity. The brilliant colors, strong ink outlines, gold-leaf background, and profusion of pictorial elements are typical of the decorative formula established by Kano Motonobu (1476–1559), founder of the Kano school of painting, while the boldness is reminiscent of his grandson, the prolific Kano Eitoku (1543–1590). The exaggerated dimensions of the pine and cedar trees, the attempt to create space for projecting branches in the crowded composition, and the depiction of brushwood hedges in high relief suggest that the work dates to the late sixteenth century. In their elegant grandeur, these screens reflect the lavish taste that prevailed in the mansions and temples of the capital during the period.	四季花鳥図屏風 Title: Birds and Flowers of the Four Seasons Period: Momoyama period (1573–1615) Date: late 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image: 63 1/4 in. × 11 ft. 10 in.

57172.jpg	Hossō Mandala		Japan	16th century	This painting is a manifestation of the transmission of Hossō-school teachings from India and China to Japan. One of the eight earliest Buddhist schools, Hossō (Faxiang in Chinese; Dharmalakshana in Sanskrit) was founded by the great monk Genjō (Xuanzang in Chinese; 596–664) and his eminent disciple Kiki, also known as Jion Daishi (Guiji in Chinese; 632–682).As the legendary founder of the Hossō sect, Miroku Bosatsu (Maitreya Bodhisattva) is enshrined as the central deity, facing forward. Depicted against a lozenge-grid background are twenty-three patriarchs of the Hossō school in three-quarter view, arranged symmetrically in two groups, flanking the central image. Each of them can be identified with a name written in a cartouche next to the image. Chinese and Japanese priests appear below the Indian patriarchs. All of the figures are portrayed wearing detailed and colorful garments in a schematic manner that suggests a date of the second half of the sixteenth century for this work.

44673.jpg	The Four Accomplishments	Kano Motonobu 狩野元信	Japanese	mid-16th century	Within a landscape of towering pines, distant peaks, and roaring waterfalls are four scenes of human activity, each alluding to one of the four pursuits deemed appropriate for Chinese gentlemen: music, the board game Go, calligraphy, and painting.Motonobu, second-generation head of the Kano School of painting, laid the groundwork for the school’s centuries of dominance over mainstream Japanese painting. One of his many achievements was the adaptation of small-scale paintings (like fans and albums) associated with specific Chinese masters to large-scale painting formats such as folding screens and panels. Here, Motonobu employs brush techniques associated with the Southern Song Chinese court painter Xia Gui (active ca. 1195–1225). ).	琴棋書画図屏風 Title: The Four Accomplishments Artist: Kano Motonobu 狩野元信 (Japanese, 1477–1559) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: mid-16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image (each screen): 67 in. × 12 ft. 6 in.

44696.jpg	Gibbons in a Landscape	Sesson Shūkei 雪村周継	Japanese	ca. 1570	Japanese Zen monks treasured pictures of gibbons painted by the Chinese monk-painter Muqi (active ca. 1250–80), which Muqi’s colleagues first carried to Japan in the late thirteenth century. By the late fifteenth century, images of the animals in the manner of Muqi had become a favored subject for large-scale painting programs.In this pair of screens, showing a uniquely Japanese interpretation of Muqi’s style, a chain of gibbons tries to grasp the reflection of the moon in the water below—a futile effort that in Zen signifies the delusions of the unawakened mind. Sesson, a learned and prolific Zen monk-artist, studied a wide array of earlier Chinese ink styles and played a major role in the development of a distinctive Japanese form of Zen-inspired ink painting.

45210.jpg	Scene from the Life of the Buddha		Japan	early 15th century	Here, the fundamental truth that suffering is the essence of life is charmingly conveyed in the story of the young prince's excursions from the palace, where he had enjoyed a sheltered life of plenty and pleasure. In the canonical iconography of the life of the Buddha, he first meets an old man, then a sick one, then a corpse, and finally an ascetic who inspires the prince to abandon life in the palace to seek the truth. However, in this work, a birth scene at the lower right replaces the customary meeting with the ascetic. The scene of a birth is rare and is probably based on the Lotus Sutra, which preaches four essential sufferings.The skillful brushwork employed for a tree in the upper left corner reflects Japanese artists' study of Chinese paintings and suggests a date in the early fifteenth century.	仏伝図 Title: Scene from the Life of the Buddha Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: early 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Section of a wall panel mounted as a hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 29 3/8 × 43 7/8 in.

45213.jpg	Scene from the Life of the Buddha		Japan	early 15th century	After Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha, was enlightened, he became a wandering teacher, delivering the message that life is suffering from which one can be released through spiritual cultivation and compassionate behavior toward all living things. This painting, from a set of eight depicting milestones in the life of the Buddha, illustrates the conversion of King Bimbisara at Vulture Peak. The Buddha is shown in deified form seated on a lotus pedestal, with his right hand raised in the gesture that indicates teaching. The lotus pedestal symbolizes the purity of Buddhist wisdom, which grows like a lotus flower from the muddy waters of delusion. All of nature—clouds, streams, and mountains—seems to emanate from his glowing figure to manifest the teaching. Heavenly beings fly from above to hear him as he sits surrounded by followers from all realms of existence. His monastic followers stand behind haloed bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who, like the Buddha in his former lives, remain in the world to help others reach enlightenment. Armored figures of the Four Guardian Kings, who protect the teaching throughout the four quarters, flank King Bimbisara and his attendants. Tiny golden wheels above their heads symbolize the Dharma, the Buddhist Law.	仏伝図 Title: Scene from the Life of the Buddha Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: early 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Section from a cycle of eight scenes from the life of the Buddha; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 29 5/8 × 43 5/8 in.

At the lower right, Shakyamuni's father, King Shuddhodana, asks women to dance and play musical instruments to entice the prince to remain. The identities of the two women inside the palace and the image of the Buddha ascending on a cloud remain problematic. Judging by the palatial surroundings, the two women could be Shakyamuni's wife, Yashodara, and her lady-in-waiting, in which case the ascending Buddha would signify Shakyamuni's departure from the palace to pursue enlightenment.	仏伝図 Title: Scene from the Life of the Buddha Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: early 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Section of a wall panel mounted as a hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 29 1/2 × 43 1/2 in.

60786.jpg	Titmouse with Pomegranate Flowers	Kano Yukinobu 狩野之信	Japanese	mid-16th century	A titmouse prepares to alight on a pomegranate branch. The use of bright green and orange-red pigments is characteristic of Kano artists inspired by bird-and-flower paintings of China’s Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Even the mounting imitates that of Ming bird-and-flower paintings, with ornate textile borders above and below. This work by Kano Yukinobu was part of a set, perhaps once mounted on a small screen.	狩野之信筆 四十雀柘榴花図 Title: Titmouse with Pomegranate Flowers Artist: Kano Yukinobu 狩野之信 (Japanese, ca. 1513–1575) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: mid-16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 18 3/8 x 15 3/4 in.

63956.jpg	The Chinese Explorer Zhang Qian on a Raft	Maejima Sōyū	Japanese	mid-16th century	This bearded Chinese gentleman engaged in a most unlikely endeavor—white-water rafting—is Zhang Qian (Japanese: Chōken), a legendary explorer of the second century B.C. Zhang was immortalized in a Yuan-dynasty poem that tells of his riding a log raft to the source of the Yellow River, only to find himself floating in the Milky Way. This painting is one of the works most reliably attributed to Maejima Sōyū, a painter active in the Kantō region of eastern Japan.	張騫図 Title: The Chinese Explorer Zhang Qian on a Raft Artist: Maejima Sōyū (active mid-16th century) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: mid-16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 20 5/16 × 13 11/16 in.

72570.jpg	Portrait of a Warrior	Unidentified artist		late 16th century	This painting of a warrior is executed at a size usually reserved for portraits of emperors and shoguns. Although the family crest of wild orange is associated with the Shibata family of the late sixteenth century, the original identifying inscription has not survived, so the sitter’s precise identity remains unknown. The unnamed samurai, clearly an important member of a warrior clan, grasps the end of his long beard—a feature banned in the seventeenth century as an expression of antiestablishment sentiment and unwelcome individualism. His eyes seem to twinkle with mischievous pleasure.Such lively, informal representation was the norm in secular depictions of deceased people, while more formality was standard in portraits of the living. A picture like this would often be dedicated to the Buddhist temple where the sitter was buried.	武将肖像画 Title: Portrait of a Warrior Artist: Unidentified artist Japanese, late 16th century Period: Momoyama period (1573–1615) Date: late 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 47 13/16 x 33 9/16 in.

As in the two sculptures of Fudō displayed nearby, in this painting the Buddhist protective deity holds a wisdom-sword in his right hand and a lasso, outlined in red, in his left. He and his four youthful attendants (dōji) are circumscribed in tiny sacred Sanskrit characters called “seed syllables” (shuji), rendered in black ink. The syllables that form the five figures’ attributes are outlined in red ink.The monk Chikai, based at Kono Shrine near Amanohashidate (Kyoto Prefecture), was associated with the Shingon (Esoteric) sect of Buddhism and known as a prolific painter of Fudō images in his day, though only a few examples survive.	不動明王四童子種字像 Title: Fudō Myōō with Four Attendants, Outlined in Seed Syllables Artist: Chikai 智海 (Japanese, ca. 1422–ca. 1503) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: Second half of the 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 39 15/16 × 17 1/16 in.

671016.jpg	The Four Deities of Mount Kōya		Japan	16th century	The temple complex on Mount Kōya, south of Kyoto and Nara, has served as the headquarters of the Shingon sect since it was established in the ninth century by Kūkai (Kōbō Daishi, 774–835), who is credited with introducing Esoteric Buddhist teachings from China. This painting shows the four primary deities, or myōjin, of Niutsuhime Shrine, a sacred site at the base of the mountain. The deities are seated on platforms before trifold screens within a shrine building whose entrance is guarded by a pair of lions. The site’s original deities, Niu and her male counterpart, the hunter deity Kariba, are shown at the top. Below them are two female deities, Kehi at right and Itsukushima at left. At the bottom of the picture are two dogs, one black and one white, who, along with their master, Kariba, are said to have originally guided Kūkai to this remote location.	高野四所明神像 Title: The Four Deities of Mount Kōya Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 40 3/16 × 19 1/2 in.

53204.jpg	The Poet Koōgimi, from the “Fujifusa Version” of Thirty-six Poetic Immortals (Fujifusa-bon Sanjūrokkasen emaki)l		Japan	15th century	We do not see the face of the poet, whose kneeling figure is all but obscured by her voluminous, layered court garb, against which the graceful fall of her black hair creates a sinuous pattern. The inscription and poems on this portrait identify the sitter as Koōgimi, lady-in-waiting to two successive emperors of the early eleventh century. The selection of poets for the “Fujifusa Version” of the Thirty-six Poetic Immortals is believed to have been edited by the courtier Fujiwara no Fujifusa (born 1295). Only eleven fragments from the handscroll, including this precious example, are known to survive. Koōgimi’s verse alludes to a failed attempt by the Shinto deity Hitokotonushi no Kami to erect a stone bridge (iwabashi) between Mount Katsuragi in Nara and Kinpusen to thesouth. The phrase “stone bridge” has thus come to suggest an interrupted love affair.Iwabashi no yoru no chigiri mo taenu beshi akuru wabishiki Katsuragi no kamiLast night’s vows of love,like a stone bridge,cannot be extended!At dawn, how sad the god of Katsuragi appears.—trans. by John T.

670886.jpg	Ariwara Narihira, from the “Fujifusa Version” of Thirty-six Poetic Immortals (Fujifusa-bon Sanjūrokkasen emaki)		Japan	first half 15th century	The poetry competition (uta-awase), a popular and challenging courtly pastime, became a frequent subject of illustrated handscrolls. During the Heian period (794–1185), selections of renowned “poetic immortals,” often thirty-six in number, were made by scholar-poets of the aristocracy. This imaginary portrait of the ninth-century courtier Ariwara no Narihira (825–880) was once part of a handscroll executed in the yamato-e (“Japanese-style painting”) mode of illustration, with details painted in thin, even lines. The tightness of the brushstrokes is characteristic of fourteenth-century works. To the left of the headnote (in Chinese) is one of Narihira’s most famous waka (31-syllable poems), here remarking on the emotional tug of seeing cherry blossoms bloom and scatter in the spring.Yo no naka nitaete sakura no nakariseba haru no kokoro wa nodokekaramashiIf only there were nocherry trees in this world,our hearts in springtimewould then perhapsnot be so aflutter.—trans. by John T.

Scenes executed in a simplified version of the classic hakubyō (white drawing) method of monochrome painting alternate with sections of text. The compositional device known as fukinuki-yatai, or “blown-away roof,” permits viewers to peer into several rooms of Prince Genji’s residence at once. Genji’s wife Aoi has just given birth to his son Yūgiri, but she dies shortly thereafter, a victim of the jealous spirit of Genji’s former lover, the Rokujō lady.	「葵」 『源氏物語』 絵巻 Title: "Heartvine" ("Aoi") chapter from The Tale of Genji (Genji monogatari) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 4 3/4 in. × 18 ft. 9 3/16 in.

At left are Hanshan and Shide (Japanese: Kanzan and Jittoku), Chan (Japanese: Zen) monks who held low-level positions at Guoqingsi, a temple on China’s Mount Tiantai. The reclusive monk-poet Hanshan, shown carrying a bucket, was said to have gathered leftover food from the temple kitchen, where he worked. Shide holds a broom indicating his role as the temple janitor. The older, contemplative figure at right is their teacher Fenggan (Japanese: Bukan) who lived, according to legend, with a pet tiger, easily overlooked as he naps by a rock. Although these paintings—once the flanking scrolls of an iconic triptych—bear no seals or signatures, they have long been attributed to Reisai based on style. Reisai was a follower of Kichizan Minchō (1352–1431), an artist active in the painting atelier of the Zen monastery Tōfukuji in Kyoto.	霊彩筆 豊干寒山拾得図 Title: Fenggan, Hanshan, and Shide Artist: Reisai (Japanese, active ca. 1430–50) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: first half of the 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image (a): 37 7/8 × 13 5/8 in.

670981.jpg	Oxherding	Sekkyakushi	Japanese	first half of the 15th century	This painting depicting a herdboy escorting an ox down a hillside path originally may have been one of ten hanging scrolls illustrating the Ten Verses on Oxherding, a Zen parable composed in eleventh-century China that became popular in Japan. If so, it likely represents the fifth verse, “Herding the Ox,” in which the herdboy has located his runaway ox and sets off on his way home. Another possibility is that it was inspired by a more secular Chinese painting of an ox and herdboy in which the image was meant to evoke the cyclical rhythms of the seasons.Although the biography of the painter Sekkyakushi remains unclear, he is believed to have been one among several followers of the early Zen monk-artist Kichizan Minchō (1352–1431), active in the painting atelier of Tōfukuji, a large Zen monastery in Kyoto.	赤脚子筆 牧牛図 Title: Oxherding Artist: Sekkyakushi (Japanese, active first half of the 15th century) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: first half of the 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 21 1/16 × 11 9/16 in.

53213.jpg	Herd Boy with Ox	Attributed to Kano Masanobu 狩野正信	Japanese	late 15th century	The bucolic scene of a herd-boy mounted on a water buffalo together making their way past rice paddies across a shallow river evokes a universally understood sense of harmony with nature while simultaneously sparking multiple associations in the context of early Japanese ink painting. While an affinity to didactic Zen Buddhist parables such as the Ten Ox‑Herding Songs is obvious, the image of an ox and ox‑herd was also emblematic of spring and agriculture, and enjoyed a long history in secular landscape painting in both China and Japan. This painting, in ink on a gilded fan, was probably based on a similar composition in a round fan-shaped painting by the thirteenth-century Chinese court painter Xia Gui, whose works were treasured in prominent Japanese collections of the fifteenth century.	牧童図扇面 Title: Herd Boy with Ox Artist: Attributed to Kano Masanobu 狩野正信 (Japanese, ca. 1434–ca. 1530) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: late 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Folding fan mounted as a hanging scroll; ink and gold on paper Dimensions: Image: 8 7/8 × 18 1/2 in.

53212.jpg	Su Shi Riding a Donkey	Bokudō Sojun	Japanese	early 15th century	This sparse painting of a man and a donkey in a windswept landscape illustrates an episode in the life of the Song-dynasty poet Su Shi (1037–1101). The aged Su, in exile, had been visiting a friend. As it began to rain when he took his leave, Su borrowed a wide-brimmed hat and clogs from a local farmer. The sight of a scholar-official from the city plodding through the rain dressed in the humble garb of a farmer is said to have startled the local women and children. The artist, Bokudō Sōjun, was a Zen monk from Tenryūji Temple in Kyoto. His use of gold outlines on Su Shi’s hat, headcloth, and the bridle bit, touches of brightness in an otherwise austere composition, may have been influenced by professional painters of the era who used gold highlighting in Buddhist paintings.	朴堂祖淳筆 蘇軾騎驢図 Title: Su Shi Riding a Donkey Artist: Bokudō Sojun (Japanese, 1373–1459) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: early 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and gold on paper Dimensions: Image: 22 1/2 × 10 1/4 in.

53231.jpg	Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove	Sesson Shūkei	Japanese	1550s	During the turbulent years of China’s early Western Jin dynasty (265–317), seven literati secluded themselves in a bamboo grove outside the capital. There they escaped from the strictures of officialdom and Confucian conduct. They drank wine, engaged in witty Daoist discourse called qingtan, and played music and chess. Their story became legend and a frequent subject of painting in China, then Japan. In this unusually exuberant interpretation by Sesson, the sages dance wildly in the company of equally ebullient women and children. Even the bamboo seems to sway to the drumbeat. Although this type of departure from traditional iconography led to the occasional characterization of Sesson as “eccentric,” he was also a Zen monk and educated painter who studied a wide array of earlier Chinese and Japanese paintings. This work can be dated to the 1550s, when he lived near Kamakura, the old administrative capital and the early medieval cradle of Zen Buddhism in Japan.	雪村周継筆 竹林七聖図 Title: Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove Artist: Sesson Shūkei (ca. 1504–ca. 1589) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 1550s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 40 5/16 × 20 3/8 in.

53223.jpg	Mountain Landscape	Traditionally attributed to Tenshō Shūbun	Japanese	early–mid-15th century	In late medieval Kyoto, cultural elites in the circle of the Ashikaga shoguns were especially interested in Chinese ink paintings. They voraciously collected works by Chinese masters and commissioned Japanese painters to create works in the style of their Chinese forebears. The compositions that make up this pair of screens are inspired by the Southern Song Chinese court painter Xia Gui (active ca. 1195–1230), whose works were highly prized in medieval Japan. Rock forms described with thick contour lines, textured by “axe-cut” brushstrokes and accented with “moss dots,” as well as paired foreground trees were immediately recognizable to the Japanese audience as elements of Xia Gui–style painting. Although later inscriptions by the painter Kano Yasunobu (1614–1685) name the original artist as the Kyoto painter Tenshō Shūbun, the paintings were not actually created as a pair. Rather, they are a later combination of two separate works, both by artists active shortly after Shūbun.	伝天章周文筆 山水図屏風 Title: Mountain Landscape Artist: Traditionally attributed to Tenshō Shūbun (Japanese, active 1414–before 1463) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: early–mid-15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 60 5/8 in. × 9 ft. 6 3/16 in.

53226.jpg	Two Views from the Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers	Kantei	Japanese	early 16th century	One of the most popular subjects in traditional Chinese poetry and landscape painting is the Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers. It highlights a region in southern China that was the source of a rich literary tradition and the locus of ancient myths and popular lore. Song Di (active 11th century), who retreated to the area after his dismissal from court in 1074, is reputed to have been the first to paint the site in a group of eight images. These codified scenes became popular in Japan, beginning in the Muromachi period.Little is known about Kantei, the artist of these two paintings, save that he may have been a monk of the Ritsu sect of Buddhism, in Nara. It is apparent that both compositions, with their strong horizontal and vertical lines, were influenced by works of the master ink painter Sesshū Tōyō (1420–1506).	鑑貞筆 瀟湘八景中の二景図 Title: Two Views from the Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers Artist: Kantei (Japanese, active second half of 15th century) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: early 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image (a): 18 1/16 × 11 3/4 in.

65392.jpg	Landscapes of the Four Seasons	Keison	Japanese	mid-16th century	In medieval Zen monasteries, it was not uncommon to find a religious artwork flanked by a pair of hanging scrolls depicting seemingly secular subjects such as landscapes or birds and flowers. Painters used a variety of compositional strategies to ensure that these diptychs would complement a central icon of a buddha, bodhisattva, or important Zen patriarch. In this pair of landscapes, for example, Keison positioned the profusion of mountains, trees, and architectural motifs at the outside edges of each picture so that they could frame a central figure.Although Keison was a professional artist, active in eastern Japan in the vicinity of Kamakura, he modeled most of his works after those of a celebrated monk-painter, Kenkō Shōkei (active ca. 1478–ca. 1523).	啓孫筆 四季山水図 Title: Landscapes of the Four Seasons Artist: Keison (Japanese, active mid-16th century) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: mid-16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink on paper Dimensions: Image (a): 38 5/16 × 19 9/16 in.

53230.jpg	Landscape with Rocky Precipice	Sesson Shūkei	Japanese	16th century	Fluid brushwork and rhythmically repeating forms characterize this imaginary Chinese landscape of mountains, a river bridged by a narrow strip of land, and lively human activity. A cluster of buildings clings to sharply rising cliffs, a forest behind them is shrouded in mist. Passenger boats glide by, travelers—one on a donkey, the others on foot—proceed from the foreground to the steep mountain path. Sesson, one of the great masters of sixteenth-century ink painting, produced varied tones of ink from rich black to pale grey which combine with diagonal brushstrokes to create the texture of rocks and crags and emphasize the peculiar concave shapes at the base of the cliffs.The painting bears the artist’s signature, and the “Shūkei” seal that he used on his late works.	雪村周継筆 山水図 Title: Landscape with Rocky Precipice Artist: Sesson Shūkei (ca. 1504–ca. 1589) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 11 7/8 × 18 3/8 in.

53228.jpg	Splashed-Ink Landscape	Bokushō Shūshō	Japanese	early 16th century	This evocative painting by Bokushō is a variation on a celebrated landscape in the haboku (splashed-ink) technique by the great master Sesshū Tōyō (1420–1506), which is now in the Tokyo National Museum. The technique, in which dark ink is applied rapidly over still‑wet, light washes to create a soft, diffused effect, with neither well‑defined contour lines nor explicit details, evokes an intuitive and contemplative mindset associated with Zen Buddhist spiritual practice. The artist Bokushō, a high‑ranking Rinzai Zen monk, also achieved renown in literary circles in Kyoto and later moved to western Honshū, where he befriended the famed ink painter Sesshū.The abbreviated, mist-laden scene is also reminiscent of the work of the thirteenth-century Chinese artist Yujian, whose ink landscape paintings were much admired in Japan.	牧松周省筆 破墨山水図 Title: Splashed-Ink Landscape Artist: Bokushō Shūshō (Japanese, active late 15th–early 16th century) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: early 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 31 1/2 × 13 3/8 in.

The brusque calligraphy by Daitokuji temple prelate Daiko Shōkaku cites a verse by the well-known Zen monk-poet Son’an (Kisei Reigen, 1402–1488). The poem reads:In the forest, when evening comes birds retire and nest together.Coupled birds remain in flight, their joined wings letting them soar,not looking for a place to spend the night.—Translation after Miyeko Murase	雲溪永怡筆 太虛祥廓賛 枝に小禽図 Title: Bird on a Branch Artist: Unkei Eii (Japanese, active first half of the 16th century) Artist: Inscribed by Daiko Shōkaku (Japanese, died 1535) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: before 1535 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 9 5/16 × 10 13/16 in.

Above Yōgetsu’s auspicious image of a pair of fish swimming in a pond, Mokumoku Dōjin, about whom little is also known, has inscribed a poem that recalls the carp’s role as a vehicle of the Daoist immortal Qingao: Wind whips the grass alongthe riverbank, frigid at dusk.A single ray of brilliant redilluminates the white shoal.If Qingao were here,he would not be riding a crane—He’d have [his carp] shaking their headsand snapping their tails,spinning waves into whirlpools.—Trans.

670896.jpg	Plum Blossoms	Motsurin Jōtō (Bokusai)	Japanese	15th century	Plum blossoms, symbolic of the arrival of spring, were a favored subject among scholar-gentleman painters in China, but when Chinese ink paintings of plums arrived in Japan their imagery became widespread within Zen circles. This composition of a gnarled plum tree framed by a circle of ink wash may reflect the use of the circle in Zen painting and calligraphy as a visual representation of words from the text of the Heart Sutra, “form is void and void is form,” and as a symbol of enlightenment.Motsurin, a Zen artist-monk, might also have chosen plum blossoms because they were beloved of his mentor Ikkyū Sōjun (1394–1481), an abbot of Daitokuji temple in Kyoto known for his poetry, calligraphy, and flagrantly unorthodox behavior. Motsurin’s inscribed text claims that even elegant peonies and sweet jasmine cannot match the plum as a representation of the spring season.	没倫紹等 (墨斎) 筆 梅図 Title: Plum Blossoms Artist: Motsurin Jōtō (Bokusai) (Japanese, died 1492) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 10 3/4 × 16 3/4 in.

670904.jpg	Melons	Yamada Dōan	Japanese	late 16th century	Images of fruits and vegetables were often displayed in Zen temples as symbolic offerings to Buddhist icons. Although similar images were produced earlier in Song dynasty China, ink paintings of isolated fruits or vegetables became popular in Japan during the late Muromachi period, when they were associated with the Chinese Chan (Zen) artist Muqi (ca. 1210–after 1269). A painting of this subject and size could have been displayed at tea gatherings during the summer season.Several generations of artists bore the name Dōan, although the seal “Yamada-shi Dōan” may have belonged to a lord of the late 15th–16th century, when much of the country was involved in civil war. Although a member of the military elite, he could have taken religious orders and entered cultivated Zen circles, learning techniques of ink painting from artist-monks to create this depiction of melons with a minimalist approach and contrasting ink tones.	山田道安筆 瓜図 Title: Melons Artist: Yamada Dōan (Japanese, second half of the 16th century) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: late 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 13 1/4 × 18 1/8 in.

The profusion of detail is characteristic of the art of Shikibu Terutada, a prolific painter active in the Kantō region of eastern Japan. Although his many extant works reveal a familiarity with Kano-school styles and compositions, Terutada is thought to have begun his career emulating the style of Kenkō Shōkei (active before 1478–ca. 1523), the central figure of painting circles in late medieval Kantō. The pair of black-backed wagtails flying at the upper right and the oriole standing sentinel at the left, for example, are identical to motifs found in paintings by Shōkei and his numerous followers.	式部輝忠筆 夏秋花鳥図 Title: Birds and Flowers of Summer and Autumn Artist: Shikibu Terutada (Japanese, active mid–16th century) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: mid-16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image (a): 37 11/16 × 17 5/8 in.

670903.jpg	Quail, Sparrows, and Millet		Japan	early 16th century	A flock of quails and pair of sparrows gather around stalks of millet, their heads heavy with ripe seed on an autumn day. The theme of quails and autumn grasses was widely depicted in China during the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279), most often by painters in attendance at the imperial court. Many works on the theme were brought to Japan and entered the collections of Buddhist temples, while a select few entered prestigious private collections such as that of the Ashikaga family, who ruled Japan as military dictators during the Muromachi period. These works served as important models for later Japanese artists. The present example reflects the unidentified Japanese painter’s familiarity with these earlier Chinese works.	鶉雀粟図 Title: Quail, Sparrows, and Millet Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: early 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 32 5/16 × 13 5/8 in.

Although not native to Japan, musk cats (jakōneko), or civets, were known in Japan through early Chinese paintings that were imported beginning in the 1200s. These nocturnal, feline mammals became a favorite subject of artists affiliated with the formidable Kano school, established in Kyoto in the late 1400s. A large square seal at lower right names the painter of thiswork as Uto Gyoshi, an obscure figure who is thought to have been affiliated with a satellite Kano studio in the eastern castle town of Odawara.	右都御史筆 麝香猫図 Title: Musk Cat Artist: Uto Gyoshi (Japanese, active second half of 16th century) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: mid–late 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 29 15/16 × 18 5/16 in.

53233.jpg	Bo Ya Plays the Qin as Zhong Ziqi Listens	Circle of Kano Motonobu	Japanese	1530s	The Liezi, a fourth-century Daoist text, records the story of Bo Ya and Zhong Ziqi, scholars renowned for their devotion to each other. Bo Ya, an accomplished player of the qin, a type of zither, would frequently play for his friend Zhong, himself a musician who truly appreciated his friend’s music. When Zhong died, however, the bereaved Bo Ya deliberately broke his instrument, never to play again. Likely once part of a set of sliding-door panels (fusuma), this painting depicts Bo Ya and Zhong Ziqi taking shelter from a storm beneath a cliff, where Bo Ya plays his qin to pass the time. The work bears no seal or signature but exemplifies the formal landscape style of the early Kano school and was traditionally attributed to the school’s founder, Motonobu. Discrepancies with Motonobu’s accepted style, however, suggest that the artist was active in Motonobu’s circle, probably during the 1530s.	狩野元信周辺 伯牙鍾子期図 Title: Bo Ya Plays the Qin as Zhong Ziqi Listens Artist: Circle of Kano Motonobu (Japanese, 1477–1559) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 1530s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 65 1/16 × 34 1/4 in.

Dandelions and violets in the right scroll suggest spring while a summertime azalea blooms nearby. The left scroll features an autumnal loquat and drying reeds alongside winter’s red-berried spear flowers. The pheasants’ plumage is highlighted in gold, befitting birds popularly associated with the deity Amaterasu, putative ancestress of the imperial family. Given this symbolic connection, this diptych may have been commissioned for an aristocrat’s household in the capital city.A leading Kano-school artist, Shōei received commissions from the Kyoto court as well as from important temples and shrines. While many of his works rely on models established by his father, Motonobu (ca. 1476–1559), the diptych’s close-up composition anticipates large-scale Kano screen painting of the Momoyama period (1573–1615).	狩野松栄筆 四季花鳥図 Title: Pheasants among Trees: Flowers of the Four Seasons Artist: Kano Shōei (Japanese, 1519–1592) Period: Muromachi (1392–1573) Date: probably 1560s Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink, color, and gold on paper Dimensions: Image (a): 37 3/8 × 18 3/8 in.

Scallop-edged golden clouds and the graceful arcs of eulalia grasses form repeating, rhythmic patterns. The treatment of pictorial elements is consistent with the gentle, elegant painting style of Kano Mitsunobu, whose works graced a number of Kyoto palaces and temples. Parallels can also be drawn to lacquer decoration at the mausoleum of warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi in Kyoto’s Kōdaiji Temple. The lacquered and maki-e–decorated panels, associated with the Kōami school of Kyoto lacquer artisans, display repeating autumn grasses resembling motifs in Mitsunobu’s paintings and this pair of screens.	四季花草図屏風 Title: Flowers and Grasses of the Four Seasons Artist: Circle of Kano Mitsunobu 狩野光信 (Japanese, 1565–1608) Period: Momoyama period (1573–1615) Date: late 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold paint, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 59 15/16 in. × 11 ft. 7 7/16 in.

78157.jpg	Portrait of Keinan Eibun		Japan	1449	This image of a seated monk is an example of chinsō, a genre of naturalistic portraiture reserved for high-ranking Zen Buddhist monks or abbots. Subjects were typically shown seated in a carved lacquer chair and wearing official robes, including the elaborate kesa, or master’s vestment; the details of their facial features were carefully reproduced. Chinsō portraits were precious artifacts of the master-disciple relationship central to Zen, and may also have been used in Buddhist ceremonies. Keinan Eibun (1365–1454) was at one time abbot of the Nanzenji Temple in Kyoto, and his inscriptions appear on several extant hanging scrolls, including on a posthumous portrait of the shogun Ashikaga Yoshinori (1394–1441). Here he is depicted at the age of seventy-nine.	景南英文像 Title: Portrait of Keinan Eibun Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 1449 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 36 1/2 in. × 15 in.

688517.jpg	Chōmeiji Temple Pilgrimage Mandala		Japan	second quarter 16th century	This painting captures the activities of a spring day at Chōmeiji Temple, situated on a hill overlooking Lake Biwa, just east of Kyoto. A wealth of details relates the activities of the temple monks and visitors, who visited the temple to make offerings to the central object of worship, an eleven-headed Kannon, the bodhisattva of compassion. Pilgrimage mandalas (sankei mandara) like this one relate the miraculous stories and seasonal activities of famous temples or shrines. Itinerant preachers used them in a form of storytelling known as etoki, or “picture-narration.” This example was no doubt employed to help raise funds for the rebuilding of the Chōmeiji Temple complex after it was razed by fire in 1516.	長命寺参詣曼荼羅図屏風 Title: Chōmeiji Temple Pilgrimage Mandala Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: second quarter 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll remounted as a two-panel folding screen; ink, color, gofun (ground shell pigment), and gold on paper Dimensions: Image: 58 3/8 × 63 3/8 in.

Founded in the late eighth century, the temple was intended to protect the capital from the north and was dedicated to Bishamonten for his role as guardian of this cardinal direction. One of the so-called Four Guardian Kings (Shitennō), Bishamonten was revered as a god of warriors. Here, he is flanked by his wife, Kichijōten, and son, Zennishi Dōji. This is among the earliest representations of Bishamonten with a centipede, which came to be recognized as his divine messenger.	鞍馬山曼荼羅・毘沙門天三尊像図 Title: Mount Kurama Mandala: Bishamonten Triad Artist: Unidentified Artist Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 15th–16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 32 13/16 × 14 3/4 in.

Following the introduction of Chinese ink works to Japan, the motif became popular among Zen painters. Each of these hanging scrolls bears the crimson seal of the monk-painter Byōsen Myōshitsu. In the work on the left, areas of uninked paper represent a layer of snow, through which the blossoms on the branch are beginning to emerge. Rendered in sweeping strokes of dark ink, the plum branch on the right is in full bloom.	平泉明室筆 墨梅図 Title: Ink Plum Artist: Byōsen Myōshitsu (Japanese, active ca. 1450–75) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 34 1/16 × 13 1/16 in.

816194.jpg	Landscape	Attributed to Sōami	Japanese	15th–early 16th century	This freely-executed ink landscape painting, rendered in soft, washy brush strokes and light wash to produce a misty, moisture-laden atmosphere, depicts a hillside sloping towards a body of water and a small figure walking along a path in the direction of a distant stand of trees. Several willows grow near the water’s edge, on a low promontory. Two boats are visible along the grassy shoreline, one of which is being poled away from shore by a solitary boatman. Sōami was one of the most important artists of late fifteenth–early sixteenth century Japan. One of the three influential “Ami school” painters—the other two were Nōami (1397–1471) and Geiami (1431–1485)—he served as art connoisseur and consultant to the Ashikaga shoguns and was familiar with the works of art they imported from China. His own painting style was inspired by the soft, misty brush technique associated with the Song-dynasty Chinese Chan (Zen) monk-painter Muqi Fachang (active ca. 1250–80), whose works were highly prized and widely collected in medieval Japan.	相阿弥筆 山水図 Title: Landscape Artist: Attributed to Sōami (Japanese, died 1525) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 15th–early 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 13 3/8 × 18 3/16 in.

816195.jpg	Hawk on a Pine	Kano Yukinobu 狩野之信	Japanese	mid-16th century	A keen-eyed hawk perches on a branch of a pine tree, peering up at the twisting branches overhead. Images of birds of prey like the hawk and the eagle, representing strength and endurance, along with symbols of longevity such as the evergreen pine, were popular among members of the military class and were often commissioned from members of the newly influential Kano school. Yukinobu and other Kano artists worked in a style that transformed the Chinese-influenced and Zen-inspired ink painting that had flourished during the preceding two centuries into a mode that appealed to warlord patrons and Buddhist clergy alike.	狩野之信筆 松鷹図 Title: Hawk on a Pine Artist: Kano Yukinobu 狩野之信 (Japanese, ca. 1513–1575) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: mid-16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 32 7/8 × 16 7/16 in.

816196.jpg	Snowy Landscape	Toki Tōbun	Japanese	ca. 1550	A rocky landscape of boulders and twisting pines dominates the curved surface of the fan painting. A distant landscape of towering peaks is partially obscured by a mist of gold wash, and in the foreground a small peasant hut is visible on the right, two boatmen on the water on the left. The composition is representative of the type of landscape image popular among Japanese ink painters of the late Muromachi period, who took as models both Chinese Southern Song dynasty academy paintings of the thirteenth century and later Chinese academic paintings of the Ming dynasty. The artist’s brushwork is characterized by a nervous, jagged line, but the handling and placement of the pictorial elements—generally weighted on the right side of the composition—the use of outlines, ink dots, and the overall theme of the image indicate that he had studied ink painting technique and was familiar with ink landscape paintings by Chinese artists, or perhaps Japanese copies of them.Little is known about the artist Tōbun, except that he may have traveled extensively throughout the country around the time the Ashikaga shogunate came to a close, in the early 1570s. Although known as an ink painter, he also produced works in the native yamato-e mode, and was, in addition, a poet.	土岐洞文筆 雪景山水図 Title: Snowy Landscape Artist: Toki Tōbun (Japanese, 1502–1582?)

752007.jpg	Memyō Bosatsu (Ashvaghosha Bodhisattva) Mounted on a Horse	Unidentified		15th–16th century	The Bodhisattva Memyō is represented sitting regally upon a white horse while balancing a scale in one hand and a red disc in the other. Memyō is the Japanese reading of the name of Indian-born Ashvaghosha (circa 80–150 AD), who was not only a scholar of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, but also a renowned poet and dramatist. His name literally means "the sound (ghosha), or neighing, of a horse (ashva)," which we can assume led to the development of the association with equine iconography. The way of representing the bodhisattva is thought to have originated from depictions of a folk deity associated with sericulture in Chinese folk religion. This deity was later assimilated into the pantheon of Buddhist deities in Japan, where he protects those involved with silkworm raising and the production or weaving of silk, and is said to provide clothing for those in need.	馬鳴菩薩像 Title: Memyō Bosatsu (Ashvaghosha Bodhisattva) Mounted on a Horse Artist: Unidentified Artist Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: 15th–16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color and gold on paper Dimensions: Image: 19 3/4 × 11 3/4 in.

He wears a Daoist robe and a hood of semitransparent gauze, and a bag hangs from his shoulder.

829383.jpg	Landscape	Unidentified		late 15th century	The individual responsible for this painting, executed in ink with touches of light color wash, was clearly influenced by Chinese Song-dynasty ink landscape paintings, as were many Japanese artists of the Muromachi period. The landscape is of a monumental type more closely associated with the Northern Song (960–1127) than the Southern Song (1127–1279), although the model could also have been a work of the early Ming dynasty (1368–1644) from a Japanese temple collection. There is a clear distinction between foreground, middle ground, and far distance, arranged with a hilly foreground from which a path and bridge lead to a middle ground with trees and a small mountain; a hint of a band of mist precedes the wall of cliffs and mountains that make up the distant ground. Architectural structures—temples or villages—are tucked away among the rocks and trees, and ink dots applied for vegetation, along with scattered axe-cut strokes typical of Chinese academic painting, indicate the artist’s familiarity with Chinese ink painting techniques. It is possible to date this work because of the inscription by the Rinzai Zen monk Ten’in Ryūtaku, known for his poems (in Chinese) on the Chinese theme of the "Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers." He was also responsible for compiling the Kinshūdan (Collection of Brocade Pieces), an anthology of Chinese poems from the Tang through the Ming dynasty.	天隠龍澤筆 山水図 Title: Landscape Artist: Unidentified Artist Artist: Inscription by Ten’in Ryūtaku (Japanese, 1422–1500) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: late 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 27 1/2 × 11 5/8 in.

829385.jpg	Birds and Flowers	Traditionally attributed to Kano Motonobu	Japanese	mid-16th century	These three paintings, a set that may have originally included a fourth, represent flowers, birds, and insects of the seasons. They also represent the early Kano-school approach to the flower-and-bird genre influenced in part by Chinese paintings. Apart from the floral subjects, landscape elements are kept to a minimum, with blank space as the primary background. The first depicts plum blossoms with bamboo and a billing pair of robins (spring), the second what appears to be hibiscus and lily with a jay(?) hovering overhead (summer), the third, plumed coxcomb keitō, with a praying mantis, a cricket, and a dragonfly (autumn). Summer and autumn bear the red cauldron-shaped "Motonobu" seal—of which several versions exist—associated with Kano Motonobu, official painter to the Ashikaga shoguns. While impressed with the seal of the master, these works might have been painted by his son Shōei (1519–1592).Motonobu, the second in a long line of Kano painters, was an influential and skillful artist whose patrons included members of the military elite, Zen Buddhist monasteries, and court nobles. He is credited with combining Zen-inspired ink painting techniques with aspects of indigenous Japanese styles (yamato-e) to create the strong and decorative style that became the model for Kano-school artists and brought him fame and success during his own lifetime.	伝狩野元信筆 花鳥図 Title: Birds and Flowers Artist: Traditionally attributed to Kano Motonobu (Japanese, 1477–1559) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: mid-16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Set of three hanging scrolls; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 19 1/8 × 12 5/8 in.

839905.jpg	Illustrated Handscrolls of The Tale of Genji	Ryūjo (Tatsujo)	Japanese	1594	This deluxe set of five handscrolls comprises text excerpts and related illustrations for all fifty-four chapters of The Tale of Genji, the monumental classic of Japanese literature of the early eleventh century authored by the court lady Murasaki Shikibu. Most remarkably, all sections are preserved intact and in correct narrative sequence. Each excerpted passage of prose mixed with poems—usually describing a crucial turning point in the plot—anticipates the painted vignette that follows. The highly skilled and refined courtly calligraphy, betraying not an instance of scribal hesitation, but never rushed or sloppy, bespeaks the practiced hand of a high-ranking woman of the palace or a wealthy warlord’s retinue who was fully familiar with courtly handwriting models. The convention of “scattered writing” (chirashi-gaki), a specialty of female calligraphers through the ages into early modern times, in which the columns of script are playfully rearranged in staggered registers across the surface of paper to create a dynamic visual effect, is magnificently executed here.The paintings do not appear to be the output of a professional artist of either the Tosa or Kano schools, as might be expected of such a major undertaking. Rather, they betray an individual and idiosyncratic painting style that we can confidently assume was brushed by Ryūjo herself. Clearly conversant with the conventions of courtly yamato-e (“Japanese style painting”), the artist was also apparently familiar with the already established iconography of the tale as utilized by the Tosa school, though in several places the artist diverged from the usual way of depicting scenes. Certain stylistic elements indicate that the artist also had familiarity with the work of the influential Kano school in Kyoto, which was by this time starting to usurp the Tosa studio’s monopoly.Although the earliest known illustrations of The Tale of Genji, from the early twelfth century, were created in the handscroll format, there are surprisingly few dated, surviving examples in this format from before the seventeenth century. This set of handscrolls constitutes the oldest dated example of a complete cycle of Genji illustrations in polychrome, with accompanying text selections, to survive intact.	龍女書 源氏物語絵巻 Title: Illustrated Handscrolls of The Tale of Genji Artist: Ryūjo (Tatsujo) (Japanese, active late 16th century) Period: Momoyama period (1573–1615) Date: 1594 Culture: Japan Medium: Five handscrolls; ink and color on paper (illustrations); ink on paper (texts) Dimensions: Scroll 1: 12 1/2 in. × 34 ft. 10 9/16 in.

845133.jpg	Plum Tree and Waterfowl	Attributed to Kano Masanobu 狩野正信	Japanese	early 16th century	A pair of water birds glide beneath the fragile branches of a plum tree in this work bearing the seals of Kano Masanobu, founder of the Kano school of painting, which dominated mainstream Japanese painting for four centuries. The plum tree’s delicate white blossoms and a tangle of drying reeds in the lower left corner are indicative of late winter. As with many other early Kano-school paintings in the bird-and-flower genre, each of the motifs is drawn with black ink outlines, while ink washes and accents are used to suggest the texture of the tree’s bark, to which malachite green lichens cling. The birds’ downy bodies are described with a meticulous application of shell white (gofun), the same pigment used for the petals of the plum blossoms.	梅に水鳥図 (Ume ni mizutori zu) Title: Plum Tree and Waterfowl Artist: Attributed to Kano Masanobu 狩野正信 (Japanese, ca. 1434–ca. 1530) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: early 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 26 1/2 × 17 1/8 in.

845134.jpg	Plantain and Bird in Snow	Kano Sōshū 狩野宗秀	Japanese	late 16th century	On this fan-shaped painting by Kano Sōshū, younger brother of the third-generation head of the Kano School, Kano Eitoku (1543–1590), a bird perches on the leafless branch of an old tree above a stream next to a tangle of Chinese lantern plants, reeds, and a plantain, its broad leaves laden with heavy, early winter snow. With the exception of the ink-lines of the flowing stream and a small number of the leaves of the Chinese lantern, most of the motifs are painted on top of a layer of shell-white pigment (gofun), itself applied directly to the paper of the fan. Some loss of the gofun have revealed Sōshū’s bold underdrawing of the plantain’s leaves, swiftly outlined for the benefit of another member of his studio who would have applied the gold leaf around primary motifs, which were left in reserve, before returning the fan to Sōshū to complete the painting. Despite these losses, Sōshū’s masterful description of the leaves’ veins and discolored edges is apparent in those parts of the leaves that were not painted on top of gofun and have thus survived mostly intact. The production of painted folding fans constituted a significant part of the Kano School’s output in the sixteenth century. Whether painted in colorful pigments and gold or rendered in ink monochrome, many were affixed bamboo ribs and actually used. This fan, however, was never mounted as a fan. It originally belonged to a set of sixty fan-shaped paintings by Sōshū that were mounted in a pair of albums that later entered the collection of the Date family, a former samurai clan and noble family. All the fans in the set were affixed with the same two artist seals seen in the present example. In the years following the fans’ first publication in 1954, they were divided into a single album of 49 paintings and a number of hanging scrolls, including the present example.	雪中芭蕉小禽図 (Setchū bashō shōkin zu) Title: Plantain and Bird in Snow Artist: Kano Sōshū 狩野宗秀 (Japanese, 1551–1601) Period: Muromachi (1392–1573) or Momoyama (1573–1615) period Date: late 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Fan-shaped painting mounted on a hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image: 14 9/16 × 20 7/8 in.

843268.jpg	Three Laughers of Tiger Ravine	Sekishō Shōan 石樵昌安	Japanese	mid-16th century	This painting captures the final moment of a legendary fourth-century encounter between three Chinese gentlemen—the Daoist master Lu Xiujing 陸修靜 (406–477), the Buddhist monk Huiyuan 慧遠 (334–416), and the poet Tao Qian 陶潜 (Tao Yuanming 陶淵明; 365–427). According to the legend, known as “Three Laughers of Tiger Ravine” (in Chinese Huxi sanxiao, and in Japanese Kokei sanshō), the monk Huiyuan, who had established the Pure Land Buddhist temple Donglinsi near the storied Lu Mountains in 386 and maintained a decades-old vow to never to leave the mountain temple, was enjoying the company of the Daoist Lu and Confucian Tao, fellow residents of the Lu Mountains area who were purported to be frequent visitors. As Huiyuan saw off his companions at the end of a long day of conversation and wine, the three wandered farther than expected, inadvertently crossing the bridge over Tiger Ravine, which marked the edge of Donglinsi’s sacred precincts. Realizing this, the three men broke out into laughter. The legend of this encounter of three celebrated figures emerged during the Song Dynasty (960–1279) and advanced a syncretic view of China’s three main belief systems—Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. It was introduced to Japan during the early Muromachi period (1392–1573), probably alongside Chinese paintings of the subject, and by the fifteenth century was a common pictorial subject associated with Japanese Zen Buddhism. During the sixteenth century, this and other Zen subjects were commonly depicted by professional painters, such as those of the Kano school. In the present example, painted late in the Muromachi period, the trio of figures standing before a bridge that spans a small creek occupies the lower half of the picture. The tonsured Huiyuan, at right, holds his hand to his head and gestures as if he’s just become aware of his transgression, while his companions laugh and point. Rocks and a wildly gnarled pine tree in the upper half of the picture hint at the landscape of the Lu Mountains.Nothing is known about the biography of the artist, Sekishō Shōan, but the dozen or so extant works bearing his seals make clear his connection to the early Kano school of painters. Unlike the main line of Kano painters in Kyoto, however, Shōan seems to have been attached to a Kano studio in eastern Japan, specifically in the eastern castle town of Odawara, near the former administrative capital of Kamakura. Like other mid-sixteenth century painters aligned with the Odawara Kano studio—artists such as Maejima Sōyū and Uto Gyoshi—Sekishō Shōan’s extant works betray his familiarity both with works by the school’s second-generation head, Kano Motonobu (1476–1559), and with an older, local tradition of ink painting in eastern Japan.	虎渓三笑図 Title: Three Laughers of Tiger Ravine Artist: Sekishō Shōan 石樵昌安 (Japanese, active mid-16th century) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: mid-16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 34 5/8 × 14 1/8 in.

853191.jpg	Rush-Sandal Chen (Chen Puxie)	Inscription by Ikkyū Sōjun	Japanese	late 15th century	Ikkyū Sōjun, an erudite monk of the Rinzai Zen sect, built a reputation as one of medieval Japan’s great eccentrics and religious iconoclasts, in part through his poetry in Chinese. The four poems he brushed on this scroll originally appeared in his Crazy Cloud Anthology (Kyōunshū), forming the first half of the section Eight Poems about Chen Puxie, which addresses the internal conflicts among, and the decline of, the Buddhist schools.Beneath is an unsigned, imaginary portrait of the Chinese monk mentioned in the section’s title. Muzhou Daoming (780–877) devoted so much of his daily routine to plaiting rush sandals that he became known as “Rush-Sandal Chen” (Chen Puxie). He would hang the shoes from the eaves of his temple to give or sell to passersby.	一休宗純賛 陳蒲鞋偈頌画 Title: Rush-Sandal Chen (Chen Puxie) Artist: Inscription by Ikkyū Sōjun (Japanese, 1394–1481) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: late 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 40 5/8 × 14 1/2 in.

853195.jpg	Gibbon and Bamboo	Sesson Shūkei 雪村周継	Japanese	16th century	This scroll painting portrays a gibbon hanging from a vine near stalks of bamboo. The gibbon’s lowered left hand suggests that he is reaching for something, probably the reflection of the moon in the water below—a scene common in Japanese gibbon paintings and one rooted in Zen Buddhist teachings about the delusional nature of the unawakened mind. Painted entirely in ink, the image belongs to a long line of monochrome Japanese simian paintings inspired by the late thirteenth-century Chinese painter Muqi, whose works, including several of gibbons, were collected in Japan during the artist’s own lifetime. Sesson Shūkei, who was raised and spent his early career in northeastern Japan, relocated in midcareer to Kamakura and nearby Odawara, cities with large Zen monasteries and powerful warrior patrons whose collections were replete with old Chinese paintings. Sesson’s work during and after this period makes clear that he closely studied paintings by Muqi and other celebrated Chinese painters of the Song and Yuan dynasties held in local collections. The work is impressed at lower right with a square, red seal reading Shūkei.	竹猿猴図 (Chikuenkō zu) Title: Gibbon and Bamboo Artist: Sesson Shūkei 雪村周継 (ca. 1504–ca. 1589) Date: 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 37 1/4 × 12 15/16 in.

843779.jpg	Bodhidharma in Red Robes	Kano Masanobu 狩野正信	Japanese	late 15th century	This picture of Bodhidharma, the fifth-century Indian monk credited with transmitting Zen Buddhist teachings to China, was likely used in ritual services at a Zen monastery. Its efficacy pivots on its ability to convey the monk’s essential message of self-reflection in the pursuit of awakening—“Look inward to become a buddha”—through the gaze of the patriarch. The artist used a series of bold, layered lines in combination with washes of vermilion to render Bodhidharma’s characteristically red robes and guide the viewer’s eye to the center of the picture. There the Zen master meets the adherent with a penetrating look, calling to mind the nine years he is said to have sat in meditation, staring at the wall of a cave.	朱衣達磨像 Title: Bodhidharma in Red Robes Artist: Kano Masanobu 狩野正信 (Japanese, ca. 1434–ca. 1530) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: late 15th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 35 7/8 × 17 5/8 in.

872017.jpg	Chinese Boys at Play	Studio of Kano Motonobu 狩野元信	Japanese	first half 16th century	A group of boys have broken into play during their studies. Writing utensils—brushes, brush rests, inkstones, books, scrolls, and silk wrapping cloths—are scattered around the space. A child naps at center while the others form a circle around him, armed with ink-dipped brushes. One boy has already begun making marks on the sleeper’s forehead; two other students inch their wet brushes closer to his face. The boys’ shenanigans extend to all the classmates—the child at lower center has his pants pulled down to expose his backside, marked with a dark smear of ink. At right, a student leaps with joy at the sight of the mischief-making while another cowers behind him. Although currently mounted as a hanging scroll, the pronounced radial creases suggest that this work was originally set on bamboo ribs and used as a folding fan.	唐子遊び図扇面 Title: Chinese Boys at Play Artist: Studio of Kano Motonobu 狩野元信 (Japanese, 1477–1559) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: first half 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Folding fan mounted as a hanging scroll; ink, color, gold, and mica on paper Dimensions: Image (fan only): 9 1/8 × 18 1/2 in.

853194.jpg	Daoist Master Fei Zhangfang	Sesson Shūkei	Japanese	ca. 1555–61	Old Chinese pictures of Daoist figures were frequently placed alongside Buddhist icons in medieval Zen temples, being ascribed talismanic power. Based on images of this type, which he gathered while traveling across Japan’s eastern provinces in the mid-sixteenth century, the monk-painter Sesson Shūkei created numerous renderings of Daoist masters. This painting depicts a moment in the biography of the semilegendary figure Fei Zhangfang, a failed disciple of the immortal Hugong. Sent home before completing his studies in Daoism, Fei tossed the staff his master had given him into a nearby pond, where it transformed into an auspicious blue dragon—as shown at lower right.	雪村周継筆 費張房図 Title: Daoist Master Fei Zhangfang Artist: Sesson Shūkei (ca. 1504–ca. 1589) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) Date: ca. 1555–61 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 27 1/4 × 13 3/8 in.

45692.jpg	River Landscape in Evening	Seal of Kano Motonobu	Japanese	16th century	This monochrome Japanese landscape painting portrays the activities of an imagined riverside locale in China. We "enter" the picture at lower right, where a man is ferried across the river toward luxurious buildings at lower left. A friend, seen through the open windows of a two-story pavilion, awaits his arrival and the beginning of an intimate evening gathering. Across the river in the right-hand middleground, fishermen have moored their thatched boats at shore at the end of the workday and walk inland toward two rustic cottages tucked into a grove of trees—a fishing village, in the vocabularly of East Asian landscape painting. Zigzagging back to the left as we move up the composition and further into the distance along the river, a cluster of low-lying, hillside buildings hints at another village, the destination for two more boats seen at upper right. The painting bears the seal of Kano Motonobu, second-generation head of the Kano school, a formidable painting workshop that emerged in the late 1400s and dominated mainstream Japanese painting for the next four hundred years. However, a significant amount of overpainting added to the work over the centuries makes its attribution especially difficult. In some passages, heavy retouching completely masks the "original" image, which may have been painted in the Japanese capital of Kyoto in the 1500s, preventing an analysis of the artist's original brushwork.	山水図 Title: River Landscape in Evening Artist: Seal of Kano Motonobu (Japanese, 1477–1559) Period: Muromachi period (1392–1573) or Momoyama period (1573–1615) Date: 16th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 25 1/2 × 12 1/2 in.

54593.jpg	Bodhidharma (Daruma)	Attributed to Kano Sanraku 狩野山楽	Japanese	17th century	Bodhidharma was an Indian monk credited with transmitting Zen Buddhist teachings to China in the 500s. Known as "Daruma" in Japan, he is revered as the first patriarch of Zen. Here he is shown seated, casting his powerful gaze directly at the viewer and biting his lower lip. Following a longstanding approach to the depiction of Bodhidharma in East Asia, the artist emphasizes the figure's unkempt facial and body hair, as well as bulging eyes framed by pronounced eyebrows. He wears simple robes and large earrings. The two red seals at the right edge of the picture, reading "Shūri" and "Mitsuyori," are consistent with those found on works by Kano Sanraku, a follower of the great Momoyama-period master Eitoku (1543–1590) who led the Kyoto branch of Kano School (Kyōgano) in the early decades of the 1600s.	達磨図 (Daruma zu) Title: Bodhidharma (Daruma) Artist: Attributed to Kano Sanraku 狩野山楽 (Japanese, 1559–1635) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 40 1/2 in. × 21 in.

45396.jpg	Painting the Eyes on a Snow Rabbit	Isoda Koryūsai	Japanese	ca. 1780	During the Edo period, as a winter amusement, children often made snow sculptures and the two most popular types were the snow rabbit (yuki usagi) and the snow Daruma (yuki Daruma). This image transports a children’s outdoor pastime into an elegant interior setting where a woman, probably the boy’s mother, paints on the eyes of a snow rabbit he holds on a lacquer tray. The seated woman wears an obi decorated with chrysanthemum flowers, while the standing younger woman has a kimono with summer hydrangeas—a reminder that people often wore garments with unseasonal references to distract from frigid or humid weather. Instead of using berries to fashion the eyes of the snow rabbit, they are being painted on as if it were a Daruma figure, on which one eye is painted when setting a goal or making a wish	雪兎図 Title: Painting the Eyes on a Snow Rabbit Artist: Isoda Koryūsai (Japanese, 1735–ca. 1790) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1780 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 23 3/4 in. × 16 in.

Snow is everywhere—on the opposite side of the river, where a torii (gate to a Shinto shrine) is dimly visible; on houses; on the boat; and on the bank where she stands. Breaking the harsh contrast of black against white are the brilliant reds of her undersash, her undergarment, and a clog, which are all delicately outlined in gold ink. Hokuba, who often signed his name Teisei Hokuba, was one of the most successful pupils of the great master Hokusai. A prolific artist, almost up to his teacher's caliber, Hokuba produced many paintings and prints.

53633.jpg	Autumn Trees and Grasses by a Stream		Japan	late 17th–early 18th century	The gently meandering stream, flowing through time and space, is unpainted except for the lines of ink that accentuate its softly curving form. A single clump of red azalea contrasts with the intense green of the pines. A glimpse of cherry blossoms in evanescent glory before they scatter on the stream marks the peak of spring, while the mountain rose (kerria) on the far bank betokens its passing.The stream flows into autumn on the left screen, through sunlit plumes of grass and huge, already brown leaves on a magnolia tree that all but obscures the bending forms of flowering bush clover and chrysanthemum beyond. To the left, golden ginkgo leaves shimmer in the late afternoon light with bold red and white maple leaves. The painting encapsulates stylistic features of Rinpa artists across a couple of generations, beginning with Tawaraya Sōtatsu in the early seventeenth century, and extending to Ogata Kōrin and anonymous Rinpa artists working in his wake.(One of a pair; see 49.35.2)	渓流春秋草木図屏風 Title: Autumn Trees and Grasses by a Stream Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th–early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: One of a pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold, and silver on paper Dimensions: 48 in. x 10 ft. 3 in.

Regional schools like the Unkoku workshop were patronized by powerful local daimyo—in this instance, the Mōri in Suō and Hagi—who brought Kyoto-trained artists to their strongholds in the provinces to underscore their cultural and military authority. The Unkoku style was characterized by a strong, tensile ink line, a composition based on a balance of wash and large unpainted areas, and a shallow spatial representation.

54791.jpg	Amida Manifesting in the Dharma-body of Expedient Means		Japan	18th century	This image of the Buddha Amida (Sanskrit: Amitābha) radiating beams of light was created as a private devotional image, most likely for the home altar of a follower of the True Pure Land School of Japanese Buddhism. Unlike deluxe icons made for major temples, a work like this one would have been attached to a paper backing before it was painted—a form of prefabrication. After the image was executed, it would have been mounted on bright silks. Similar examples produced today are sometimes made in sets of three, with Amida at the center; Shinran, the founder of True Pure Land Buddhism, to the right; and Rennyo, the reviver of Honganji Temple, to the left. Alternatively, Amida is flanked by calligraphic inscriptions of ten and nine characters, respectively, known as myōgō. The simplest myōgō used in True Pure Land Buddhism is six characters, and translates to “Hail the name of Amida Buddha.” Although some of the pigments are lost, much of the cut silver foil remains, and is untarnished.The rays of light symbolize the forty-eight vows made by Amida when he was a bodhisattva to help others attain enlightenment.	方便法身尊影 Title: Amida Manifesting in the Dharma-body of Expedient Means Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Ink, color, and cut silver on silk Dimensions: 14 x 6 1/2 in.

45361.jpg	The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter		Japan	late 17th century	In the classical narrative depicted here, a baby found in a glowing bamboo stalk by an old bamboo cutter grows to be a woman of unearthly beauty. Unwilling to marry, Kaguya-hime (The Shining Princess) sets her suitors tasks they are unable to fulfill. The emperor desires her, but she reveals that she is from the moon and will soon return there. Although the emperor sends soldiers to guard her, a retinue from the moon arrives and ascends to the moon with her. The lacquer storage box for these three volumes is decorated with a maki-e (“sprinkled picture”) design of a bamboo grove, two birds, and the crest of the Tokugawa family.	竹取物語 Title: The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hand-illustrated set of three volumes; ink, color, gold, and silver on paper Dimensions: 9 1/8 x 6 9/16 in.

45362.jpg	Tales of Ise (Ise monogatari)		Japan	18th century	The Tales of Ise (Ise Monogatari) is a tenth-century collection of some 125 brief tales in which poems are the central element. Together with the Kokinshū, the first imperial compilation of poetry (ca. 905), it was a requisite part of a literate person's education for over eight centuries until the modern ear. Sumptuously illustrated manuscripts such as this set of three books would have been a prized part of a dowry and a proud possession of an upper-class family. In this example, forty-nine jewel-like miniatures rendered in brilliant mineral colors and framed in stylized cloud bands of sprinkled gold foil follow widely used conventions of the Tosa-school artists.

40427.jpg	Birds Pursued by an Eagle		Japan	late 17th century	An avian drama plays out near the water’s edge as a dark-colored eagle pursues a white swan, and this sudden disturbance in the sky creates a commotion among the smaller creatures, including black myna birds and a duck. Modeled after a Chinese painting of the Ming era (1368–1644), when this particular subject was popular, the unknown artist of this painting most likely followed the example of one of Japan’s favorite Chinese artists—perhaps Ling Liang (act. 15th century)—using dark, broadly applied ink to cursorily define the rocks and introduce the agitated movements of the animals. The early-summer hibiscus offers viewers a respite in this scene of struggle.

44918.jpg	Rough Waves	Ogata Kōrin	Japanese	ca. 1704–9	Many artists and poets of the East and West alike have striven to capture the transitory and fleeting image of swelling waves. Kōrin’s rendition—one of Japan’s most striking representations of this amorphous, ungraspable form—has a strangely menacing feel, due no doubt to the long, tentacle-like fingers of foam, punctured here and there by openings. Outlined in ink using the ancient Chinese technique of drawing with two brushes held together in one hand, the clawlike waves are peculiarly reminiscent of dragons’ talons. The immediate inspiration for the screen may have been images by Sesson Shūkei (ca. 1504–ca. 1589), whose extant works include a number of dynamic and mysterious renderings of waves.The screen bears a seal reading “Dōsū,” the name Kōrin adopted in 1704. Recent research suggests that the screen was executed between 1704 and 1709, when Kōrin was residing in Edo (now Tokyo).	波濤図屏風 Title: Rough Waves Artist: Ogata Kōrin (Japanese, 1658–1716) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1704–9 Culture: Japan Medium: Two-panel folding screen; ink, color, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image: 57 11/16 × 65 1/8 in.

44897.jpg	Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers	Kano Tsunenobu	Japanese	late 17th–early 18th century	The theme of the Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers, which celebrates the landscape of an area in southern China where two rivers converge, emerged in painting and poetry in eleventh-century China. Thirteenth-century monochrome ink paintings of the theme found their way into Japanese collections by the fourteenth century, and the theme remained a major painting subject in Japan for the next five hundred years. This take on the theme by Kano Tsunenobu, second-generation head of the Kobikichо̄ branch of the influential Kano house of painters, opens with a an early spring scene—“Mountain Market in Clearing Mist”—in which plum trees blossom beside the gate to a village. The scenes continue from right to left in seasonal order, "Evening Bell from a Mist-shrouded Temple," "Sails Returning from a Distant Shore," "Autumn Moon over Dongting Lake," "Night Rain over the Xiao and Xiang," "Evening Glow over a Fishing Village," and "Geese Alighting on a Sandy Shore." The scroll ends with a wintry scene, "River and Sky in Evening Snow," which shows pavilions and trees laden with snow in the garden of a luxurious countryside estate, and a view of a waterfall crashing amongst distant, snowcapped peaks.	狩野常信筆 潇湘八景図巻 Title: Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers Artist: Kano Tsunenobu (Japanese, 1636–1713) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th–early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: 12 3/4 in. × 16 ft. 1 1/4 in.

45094.jpg	Beauty Playing a Shamisen		Japan	second quarter of the 17th century	At one time part of a larger composition, perhaps of outdoor merrymaking, this image of a woman plucking a samisen captures the pathos that underlies a scene of pleasure. The three-stringed lute, adapted from an instrument imported from the Ryūkū Islands in the mid-sixteenth century, was associated with the Edo-period world of pleasure quarters and theater. Although the work is badly damaged, the delicate drawing—especially the hands, face, and hair—admirably conveys emotion and character. Both the drawing and the style of the hair and robe point to the second quarter of the seventeenth century, when entertainers were portrayed in genre scenes, prior to the emergence of isolated images of beauties in the late seventeenth century.

48972.jpg	Red and White Poppies	School of Tawaraya Sōtatsu	Japanese	17th century	Unlike many themes in the repertoire of Rinpa artists, poppies do not figure prominently in classic literature. In fact, this beloved flower, often depicted in Edo period painting, seems to have been introduced to Japan only in the 1630s as an exotic medicinal herb, the result of a growing interest in natural sciences. Here, boldly arranged in two clumps within the narrow vertical format and rendered in the heavy mineral pigments that characterize the works of Sōtatsu and his followers, this decorative rendition of the poppies nevertheless reveals a careful attention to naturalistic detail. These characteristics are notable in the work of Sōsetsu, who by 1639 had taken over Sōtatsu's atelier, as well as the use of his Inen seal, a version of which is impressed on this work.

45368.jpg	Scene from “Imperial Visit to Rokuhara,” from The Tale of the Heiji Rebellion (Heiji monogatari)		Japan	18th century	The Tale of the Heiji Rebellion tells the story of a short civil war (1159–60) fought in Kyoto between two rival clans, headed by the warriors Minamoto no Yoshitomo and Taira no Kiyomori. The “Imperial Visit to Rokuhara” chapter deals with the escape of Emperor Nijō and his empress consort from the imperial palace, where they had been kept in captivity by the Minamoto clan, and their move to Kiyomori’s residence in the Rokuhara district. The Taira forces managed to smuggle the emperor out of the palace disguised as a lady-in-waiting. The dynamic composition and detailed depiction of the warriors suggest the tense atmosphere during the upheaval.	「六波羅行幸」 平治物語絵巻 断簡 Title: Scene from “Imperial Visit to Rokuhara,” from The Tale of the Heiji Rebellion (Heiji monogatari) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll segment mounted as a hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 11 3/4 x 35 1/4 in.

45341.jpg	Hawks with Pine Trees and Camellias; Small Birds with Willows and Camellias	Attributed to Mitani Tōshuku	Japanese	early 17th century	The simple contrast of two impressive trees—a thin, supple willow and a mighty pine—dominates this composition. The artist has skillfully utilized the two trees to evoke their symbolic associations: purity (the pine) and vitality (the willow). In this regal environment, the predatory hawks, ironically juxtaposed with the blossoms, suggest the indifference of the natural order. The hawk, a symbol of kings, was a favorite theme of Japanese warlords during the era of civil wars.Recent scholarship has helped attribute these screens to Mitani Tōshuku, a member of the Unkoku school. Founded by Unkoku Tōgan (1547–1618), a master of the Momoyama period, the Unkoku school enjoyed longlasting patronage in southern Japan. Although he did not use the Unkoku name, Mitani Tōshuku was a prominent member of the school. The dense foliage of the pine tree, the strong chiaroscuro defining its branches, the dark shadings on the hawks, and the protective pose of the bird toward its chicks closely resemble a painting that bears Tōshuku’s seals.	三谷等宿筆 伝三谷等宿筆 松と椿に鷹・柳と椿に小禽図屏風 Title: Hawks with Pine Trees and Camellias; Small Birds with Willows and Camellias Artist: Attributed to Mitani Tōshuku (Japanese, 1577–1654) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 58 7/16 in. x 10 ft. 8 13/16 in.

45695.jpg	Chinese Women and Children in a Palace Garden	Formerly attributed to Kano Eitoku	Japanese	first half 17th century	Images of women and children in a springtime garden were ubiquitous in Japan in the Edo period. The subject was commonly featured on precious objects made for brides and in the interior decorations of Buddhist nunneries, where aristocratic women often lived in retirement. In this example, women play chess in the right-hand panels, and they safeguard children playing at left.	伝狩野永徳筆 唐美人唐子図屏風 Title: Chinese Women and Children in a Palace Garden Artist: Formerly attributed to Kano Eitoku (Japanese, 1543–1590) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: first half 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Six-panel folding screen; ink, color, gold, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: 65 1/4 x 146 1/4 in.

Some of the children pull a flower cart (hana-guruma) laden with a bamboo basket overflowing with peonies (emblematic of riches and honor) and other flowers associated with good fortune. The figures display the artist’s awareness of Chinese traditions; in China the theme of One Hundred Boys was a popular and auspicious subject for painting, and in Japan the motif of karako (Tang-Dynasty Children) symbolized longevity and health for offspring. The elegant fusion of ink and colors and the tight spatial composition mark an accomplished Kano-studio product.	狩野周信筆 七福神唐子図屏風 Title: Seven Gods of Good Fortune and Chinese Children Artist: Kano Chikanobu (Japanese, 1660–1728) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 17th–18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Six-panel folding screen; ink, color, and gilt on paper; Reverse side: ink, color, and gold on paper Dimensions: 69 1/4 in. × 12 ft. 9 in.

48922.jpg	Fans upon Waves		Japan	mid-17th century	Wave-based imagery and designs, popular among painters of the Rinpa school, are here combined with another favorite image, the folding fan (ōgi). A screen ornamented with fans acted as a sort of miniature museum where many works of art could be viewed at once. The fans often appeared against a background of flowing water, a type of imagery that may have evolved from the medieval custom of casting fans into the water to float upon the surface. Screens painted with the fans-and-stream motif, known as “fans afloat” (senmen nagashi), were often installed in shogunal residences and may have derived from a tale about a Muromachi-period shogun who accidentally dropped a fan from a bridge.	波に扇面流し図屏風 Title: Fans upon Waves Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Six-panel folding screen; ink, color, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: 40 3/16 in. × 9 ft. 5 5/16 in.

45759.jpg	Dancers		Japan	late 17th–early 18th century	The male and female performers on this screen wear sumptuously decorated kosode. The hairstyles and decorative motifs on the costumes reflect fashion trends of the Kanbun period (1661–72), though the work might have been painted slightly later. The well-balanced presentation of figures embodies the elegance and reserved movements of Japanese dance. It also points to the importance of fans in the overall scheme of a performance and demonstrates how the flowing sleeves of a costume were used to accent the fluid lines created by dancers.Japanese dance underwent a transition during the seventeenth century. The religious and festival themes that had characterized prior dance forms declined in the regimented environment created by the Tokugawa shogunate. Older traditions were absorbed and transformed into different dances and incorporated into other performing arts, most notably Kabuki, which began as a form of female dance performance and evolved. The two figures to the left appear to be young male Kabuki actors. Within the rising urban milieu, these new dance forms grew in popularity.The panels were originally part of a pair of six-panel folding screens. At some point, the panels were seperated and some were lost. The present screen is a combination of the surviving panels.	舞伎図屏風 Title: Dancers Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th–early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Six-panel folding screen; ink, color, and gold on paper Dimensions: 50 3/16 in. × 11 ft. 4 5/16 in.

48974.jpg	Poppies	Attributed to Kitagawa Sōsetsu		mid-17th century	This work is traditionally attributed to Kitagawa Sōsetsu, one of the top pupils of Tawaraya Sōtatsu, who is recognized as the founder of Rinpa, a school of painting famous for stylized and often colorful depictions of natural forms. But exactly who created this composition is hard to pin down since a number of Tawaraya Sōtatsu’s pupils appear to have used “I’nen” seals, similar to the one found on this painting. The stock-in-trade of the artists who used the “I’nen” seal at this time were screens, scrolls, and fans lavishly painted with trees, plants, or flowers, as seen here. As with all Rinpa vegetal motifs, there is a balance between stylization and naturalism. The plants are identifiable but reflect a decorative intent, for they seem completely detached from any real landscape.	芥子図 Title: Poppies Artist: Attributed to Kitagawa Sōsetsu (active 1639–50) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; color and gold on paper Dimensions: 34 1/4 x 14 5/8 in.

49082.jpg	Chinese Portrait Painter	Miwa Zaiei	Japanese	18th century	A Chinese painter dressed in the style of the Tang dynasty (618–907) is painting a small portrait of a beautiful lady who stands in front of him adjusting her hair. The small painting-within-a-painting faithfully replicates the lady's face. The screen painting itself is a testament to the sometimes conflicting ideals held by eighteenth-century Japanese artists. Although nothing is known about the background of the artist, named Miwa Zaiei, except that he lived and worked in the city of Edo, he must have been affected by the concept of Western realism, which had become fashionable in eighteenth-century Japanese art and prompted him to portray the painter in the act of painting his subject in the flesh. Ironically, however, Zaiei still felt compelled to follow the traditional practice of creating an imaginary setting from ancient China for his image of presumably "real" life.

45723.jpg	Album of Hawks and Calligraphy	Kano Tsunenobu	Japanese	17th–18th century	This album containing pictures of hawks—posed on boughs or rocks, awaiting their prey, and one with its prey already ensnared—was probably created for a young male member of the samurai elite, to instill appreciation for hawking and Chinese learning. The calligraphy, by an unidentified artist, is inscribed on sumptuously colored silk decorated with golden phoenixes, and the content is taken from a Confucian didactic text. Tsunenobu was a painter in the service of the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1650, while still a teenager, he took over from his father as the head of the Kobikichō Kano school in Edo. Hawking had become the exclusive right of samurai earlier in the seventeenth century, during the reign of Ieyasu, the first Tokugawa shogun, who was an avid practitioner. But between 1693 and 1709, toward the end of the artist’s life, hawking had been temporarily suspended by his primary patron, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (1646–1709). Though Tsunayoshi was tyrannical in his politics, he was famous for his compassion toward birds and animals, to the extent that he made maltreatment of dogs a capital offense, earning him the nickname the Dog Shogun. Tokugawa Yoshimune (1684–1751), the eighth shogun, revived falconry for the warrior class, and authored a treatise on crane hawking.	十鷹書画冊 Title: Album of Hawks and Calligraphy Artist: Kano Tsunenobu (Japanese, 1636–1713) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 17th–18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Album of ten paintings; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Each leaf: 10 3/4 × 9 7/16 in.

44674.jpg	Farmers' Lives in the Twelve Months		Japan	late 17th–early 18th century	Rice continues to be the main staple of Japanese diet. During the Edo period, rice production became especially significant: feudal lords (daimyō) measured their wealth by it and peasants were required to pay taxes with it.This screen depicts the process of rice cultivation according to the classic Japanese tradition of presenting human activities through seasonal changes. On the farthest right panel, farmers share rice cakes and tea for the New Year in the early spring. The action then progresses from plowing to planting to harvesting, culminating on a snowy day in the winter when the rice is baled and the warehouse filled. These screens offer a rare glimpse into the lifestyles of peasants and demonstrate how daily activities dictated their material needs.	農耕作月次図屏風 Title: Farmers' Lives in the Twelve Months Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th–early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image (each screen): 48 7/8 x 120 11/16 in.

45373.jpg	Immortals	Hasegawa Sakon 長谷川左近	Japanese	ca. 1620s–30s	The Chinese Daoist immortals are legendary mountain recluses who attained supernatural powers and longevity by practicing meditation and alchemy. Auspicious personalities, they became a popular subject for screens and sliding-door panels in sixteenth-century Japan. The attributes seen here, such as the flute, the basket of life-extending fungus, and the gourd, suggest that these figures represent four of the Eight Immortals. The remaining four (including the two female immortals) were presumably depicted on the missing mate to this screen.The Hasegawa workshop was one of the most important producers of screens and paintings for the great lords and merchants of the Momoyama (1573–1615) and early Edo periods. This example demonstrates the Hasegawa expertise both with ink and with exotic Chinese subjects. Bold, exaggerated brushstrokes give the figures their eccentric energy—an effect enhanced by the shallow foreground space framed by the pine and rocks.	群仙図屏風 Title: Immortals Artist: Hasegawa Sakon 長谷川左近 (Japanese, born 1593) Period: early Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1620s–30s Culture: Japan Medium: Six-panel folding screen; ink and gold on paper Dimensions: 58 1/4 in. × 10 ft. 1 3/4 in.

48979.jpg	Morning Glories	Tawaraya Sōri		18th century	This understated painting of morning glories in various stages of bloom shows a fluent use of Rinpa idioms, such as the mottled-ink (tarashikomi) technique seen in the leaves. Also characteristic of the Rinpa aesthetic is the elegantly spacious arrangement of the morning-glory vine within the horizontal composition. Signed “Hyakurinsai Sōri” and accompanied by a seal reading “Genchi,” of the circular type used by Sōtatsu and Kōrin, this is a Rinpa-style work by an Edo painter who has in the past been mistakenly identified with Hokusai.	俵屋宗理筆 朝顔図屏風 Title: Morning Glories Artist: Tawaraya Sōri (active late 18th century) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Two-panel folding screen; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 19 15/16 × 65 3/16 in.

This early work by Hanabusa Itchō was created when he still viewed himself as a follower of the academic Kano school. Best known as a brilliant observer of life in Edo (present-day Tokyo), his genre paintings often display a humorous touch.	英一蝶筆 地蔵菩薩図 Title: Jizō Bosatsu Artist: Hanabusa Itchō (Japanese, 1652–1724) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1667–98 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold paint on paper Dimensions: Overall with mounting: 57 1/4 × 15 7/16 in.

45734.jpg	Quail and Millet	Kiyohara Yukinobu	Japanese	late 17th century	Tranquility pervades this delicate rendition of a traditional subject. Yukinobu, one of the few known female painters of the Edo period, was the daughter of Kusumi Morikage (ca. 1620–1690), a distinguished painter. Like her father, she reworked conventional themes from Muromachi ink painting in a personal manner. Here, the asymmetrical composition and realism recall twelfth-century Chinese academic prototypes of the subject, but Yukinobu’s treatment is distinctive for its delicate hint of domestic harmony in the disposition of the quail and the gently swaying stalks of grain.	粟に鶉図 Title: Quail and Millet Artist: Kiyohara Yukinobu (Japanese, 1643–1682) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: 46 5/8 x 18 3/4 in.

45794.jpg	Two Beauties after the Bath	Torii Kiyonaga	Japanese	18th century	Kiyonaga's artistic output was largely devoted to prints. This painting, one of the earliest o his twenty-nine known paintings, shows two women after their bath. The seated woman reads a book entitled Contemporary Fashion. With their hair in bow-curved side locks, popular during the 1780s, these women are themselves reflections of contemporary fashion. Their slightly angular faces and the relative shortness of the standing figure reflect Kiyonaga's early style. The open paper doors suggest the arrival of warm weather, and the space beyond the railed veranda imparts a feeling of airiness. Kiyonaga captures the texture and transparency of the robes, while the arm partially seen through the garment adds to the sensuousness of the scene.

45327.jpg	Quail and Autumn Flowers	Tosa Mitsuoki	Japanese	late 17th century	Elegant in their own right, chrysanthemums often appear together with quails in paintings. The combination was especially favored by Southern Song Chinese artists, as it signified peace and longevity. Along with chysanthemums, the depiction of other autumn flowers, such as bush clover (hagi) and Chinese bellflowers (kikyō), creates a seasonal setting for the pair of birds.The painting is signed by Tosa Mitsuoki, a master of jewel-like painting in finely executed line and brilliant color. He became an official court artist in 1654 and made concerted efforts to revive the dwindling fortunes of the Tosa school, which had been all but overshadowed by the Kano school since the Muromachi period.	秋の花に鶉図 Title: Quail and Autumn Flowers Artist: Tosa Mitsuoki (Japanese, 1617–1691) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: 38 1/2 x 16 3/8 in.

57173.jpg	Winter Landscape	Kano Sansetsu 狩野山雪	Japanese	second quarter of the 17th century	Wintry Chinese landscapes were a favorite subject of Kano Sansetsu, fitting for a painter whose name literally means “Mountain Snow.” Second-generation head of the Kyoto branch of the Kano school of painters (Kyōgano-ke), Sansetsu is perhaps best known for his beguiling, large-scale paintings in rich color and gold, exemplified by The Met’s Old Plum (1975.268.48a–d), one of his masterworks in this mode. But he was equally at home working in ink monochrome at a smaller scale. In this narrow hanging scroll composition, a lone man wearing a wide-brimmed hat rides his donkey along a riverbank, past a bridge and old tree. Perhaps his destination is the large pavilion seen between the snowy mountains above. Or maybe he is just passing through this desolate snowscape. Both primary motifs—the lone donkey rider with wide-brimmed hat near an old tree and the three snowy peaks—can be found in a number of other paintings by Sansetsu, either as individual compositions or worked into larger scale compositions on folding screens or panels. They are thought to have been inspired by a well-known landscape of the same subject by the thirteenth-century Chinese painter Liang Kai 梁楷 (ca. 1140–ca. 1210) that has been in Japan since at least the fifteenth century.	雪中山水図 Title: Winter Landscape Artist: Kano Sansetsu 狩野山雪 (Japanese, 1590–1651) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: second quarter of the 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 29 3/16 × 9 7/16 in.

Shunshō—an Edo bon vivant, painter, and print designer-was renowned for his facility in depicting actors and beautiful women. This early summer picture depicts a young woman from a good family standing under a willow tree. The poem at the top, composed and inscribed by Fūdo, a kyoka (satirical poem) poet, reads: The willows would leaf in profusion in an answer to the water's invitation.

Framed by a tall tree and a meandering stream, the fireflies that rise from the bushes and the two willowy women capture a sense of evening cool. The painter of this elegant nocturnal scene belonged to the Kawamata school of ukiyo-e painting, which developed delicate, doll-like figures of youthful women, the type that was perfected by Harunobu in the second half of the eighteenth century.

45721.jpg	Yang Guifei Playing a Flute	Kano Tsunenobu	Japanese	17th–18th century	Academic painters in the Edo period also sought to represent beauties in their paintings, but drew on a continental figure painting tradition instead of using the demimond directly as their subject. Yang Guifei, ill-fated concubine of the Tang emperor at the time of the An Lushan rebellion and most likely first known through a poem by Bai Luodian (772–846), was a metaphor for womanly beauty from very early times. There are references to her in the eleventh-century Tale of Genji [Genji Monogatari] and in the slightly earlier Pillow Book [Makura sōshi]. By the seventeenth century, her perosnification of fleshly beauty was so pervasive it was used to sell skin-whitening cream, a product described in a short vignette in The Mirror of Townsmen in our Land [Honcho chōnin kagami], a collection of merchant tales written by the novelist Saikaku (1642–1693) and published a year after his death.	狩野常信筆 楊貴妃吹笛図 Title: Yang Guifei Playing a Flute Artist: Kano Tsunenobu (Japanese, 1636–1713) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 17th–18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: 35 3/4 x 13 in.

The scene parodied here refers to the moment when the story's protagonist, Genji, glimpses the young Murasaki for the first time, gazing upon her as she sorrowfully observes a baby sparrow that has gotten free of its cage. Murasaki would later become Genji's favorite love. The artist has translated the figure of Murasaki into a confident, contemporary woman, standing in an assured pose and flanked by cherry blossoms. She assumes a central position, while the spying Genji has been eliminated from the scene. Instead, it is the viewer who is invited to observe her beauty.

45743.jpg	Scene from The Tale of Genji: Chapter 4, "Evening Face" (Yūgao)	Tosa School	Japanese	17th century	This scene illustrates a celebrated chapter in The Tale of Genji, “Evening Faces (Yūgao).” Genji stops to inquire after his old nurse and glimpses pretty foreheads in the humble house next to the nurse’s home. He looks up at white “evening faces,” flowers over the wall of the house, and asks his attendant Koremitsu to break one off. A pretty little girl comes out and hands him a heavily scented white fan, saying, “Put it on this. It is not much of a fan, but it is not much of a flower either.” Genji then begins his ephemeral and tragic affair with Yūgao. Shortly thereafter, Yūgao dies as a result of the jealousy of Rokujō Lady.

53632.jpg	Spring Trees and Grasses by a Stream		Japan	late 17th–early 18th century	The gently meandering stream, flowing through time and space, is unpainted except for the lines of ink that accentuate its softly curving form. A single clump of red azalea contrasts with the intense green of the pines. A glimpse of cherry blossoms in evanescent glory before they scatter on the stream marks the peak of spring, while the mountain rose (kerria) on the far bank betokens its passing. The stream flows into autumn on the left screen (15.127), through sunlit plumes of grass and huge, already brown leaves on a magnolia tree that all but obscures the bending forms of flowering bush clover and chrysanthemum beyond. To the left, golden ginkgo leaves shimmer in the late afternoon light with bold red and white maple leaves. The painting encapsulates stylistic features of Rinpa artists across a couple of generations, beginning with Tawaraya Sōtatsu in the early seventeenth century, and extending to Ogata Kōrin and anonymous Rinpa artists working in his wake.(One of a pair; see 15.127)	渓流春秋草木図屏風 Title: Spring Trees and Grasses by a Stream Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th–early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: One of a pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold, and silver on paper Dimensions: 48 in. x 10 ft. 3 in.

The present screen echoes Sōtatsu’s earlier composition with its gold-filled cloud formations and its rocks in vibrant shades of brown, blue, and green. However, growing from the rocks are maple trees with autumnal leaves, not pines, and newly introduced are two empty boats adrift on gently rolling waves. These details generate a somber, mysterious atmosphere.	波に舟図屏風 Title: Boats upon Waves Artist: Studio of Tawaraya Sōtatsu (Japanese, ca. 1570–ca. 1640) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid- to late 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Six-panel folding screen; ink, color, and gold on paper Dimensions: 61 1/8 in. × 11 ft. 9 3/4 in.

39664.jpg	Irises at Yatsuhashi (Eight Bridges)	Ogata Kōrin	Japanese	after 1709	The stately, vertical forms of irises set against an angular bridge that sweeps diagonally across both screens refer to an episode in The Ise Stories (Ise monogatari). Exiled from Kyoto after an affair with a high-ranking court lady, the story’s protagonist stops at Yatsuhashi, a place where a stream branches into eight channels, each with its own bridge. The sight of irises prompts him to compose a nostalgic love poem. The first syllable of each line forms the Japanese word for irises (kakitsubata). The English translation, though unable to convey the complex wordplay of the original, is also an acrostic:Karagoromo kitsutsu narenishi tsuma shi areba harubaru kinuru tabi o shi zo omouI wear robes with well-worn hems,Reminding me of my dear wifeI fondly think of always,So as my sojourn stretches on Ever farther from home,Sadness fills my thoughts. —Trans.

The sheets of calligraphy with painting are underlaid by Maruyama Ōkyo's autumn suzuki grasses rendered in gold pigment. This work shows how the Chinese Northern Song literati theme of place and political exile was transformed into a Japanese landscape theme of seasonal reference and atmosphere.

45755.jpg	Bugaku Scroll		Japan	17th century	As early as the seventh or eighth century, when formal diplomatic contacts between Japan and the Asian continent were at their peak, dance and music from central and southeast Asia, China, and Korea were combined with native Shinto song for court performances known as gagaku. Bugaku is the dance repertoire of gagaku. Performed by court nobles and by hereditary guilds of professional musicians at rituals and banquets, gagaku was an important part of life at court, particularly during the Heian period (794–1185), and is still performed today. The exotic colors, patterned spatial design of the choreography, and highly controlled energy of the dancers and musicians stand out in this seventeenth-century recording of the tradition.

45422.jpg	Rock and Waves	Maruyama Ōkyo 円山応挙	Japanese	dated 1773	The many streams and rivers in the mountains around Kyoto surely were the inspiration for Ōkyo's prolific studies of rocks and water, in which he seeks to capture the peak moment of their incessant movement. This screen is one of the smaller paintings Ōkyo made of the subject, but it is a concise statement of the essential features of the wave as it lingered in his mind for so many years. Great commotion and energy converge on the obstinate stone in the center of the composition, the waves hurling themselves against it only to be thrown into the air. Ōkyo has skillfully taken advantage of the congruence between his subject and his ink-splash technique.

45182.jpg	The Battle of Yashima, from The Tale of the Heike (Heike monogatari)	Tosa School	Japanese	17th century	Social upheaval and rivalries among military clans were hallmarks of the late Heian period (794–1185). A decades-long conflict between the Taira and Minamoto families over imperial dominance culminated in the Genpei War, a struggle recounted in The Tale of the Heike, compiled before 1330. At the naval Battle of Yashima in 1185, Minamoto warriors routed the Taira from their encampment by the Inland Sea. On the screen at right the young and unproven Minamoto archer Nasu no Yoichi rides his horse into the sea to shoot a distant battle fan bobbing in the prow of a Taira woman’s boat. Enmity gives way to admiration as both sides hail his remarkable achievement.	土佐派 屋島合戦図屏風 Title: The Battle of Yashima, from The Tale of the Heike (Heike monogatari) Artist: Tosa School Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: One of a pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image: 59 in. × 11 ft. 1 1/4 in.

45095.jpg	The Torii Gate of Gion Shrine		Japan	early 17th century	This bird’s-eye view of the entrance to Gion Shrine, known today at Yasaka Shrine, offers a lively scene of seventeenth-century Kyoto. Entering and leaving through the red torii gate are festively clad citizens of various classes. In the street market nearby, vendors enjoy a bustling trade selling fish, rice cakes, and tobacco. Such activities are among the pleasures still associated with visits to the shrine, which is famous for its buildings that assimilate Buddhist temple architecture. The shrine is also recognized for its prominence during the Gion Matsuri, Kyoto’s most important festival. A six-panel screen (Suntory Museum, Tokyo) and two-panel screen (Museum for East Asian Art, Cologne) depicting the festival and its setting matches The Met screen in figure style, composition, and treatment of landscape and cloud patterns, indicating that this painting was once part of a llarger painted sliding-door composition.	祇園大鳥居屏風 Title: The Torii Gate of Gion Shrine Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Sliding doors (fusama) remounted as a two-panel folding screen; ink, color, and gold on paper Dimensions: 60 in. × 64 1/4 in.

44914.jpg	Red and White Poppies	Traditionally attributed to Tosa Mitsumochi	Japanese	early 17th century	The summer motif of red and white poppies arrayed across the gold-leaf surface of the screen is a decorative formula that developed during the seventeenth century and was taken up by various schools throughout the Edo period. An unusual feature of this painting is the pattern of family crests that decorates the lattice fence. In the lower right corner an inscription by Ogata Kōrin (1658–1716) attributes the work to the court painter Tosa Mitsumochi, who died a century before the celebrated Rinpa artist was born. The attribution, however, is speculative; based on its style, the work probably dates to the early seventeenth century. Nevertheless, the screen reveals the kind of court paintings that Kōrin, famous for formalized depictions of natural themes, had direct access to and would have studied.	伝土佐光茂筆 芥子図屏風 Title: Red and White Poppies Artist: Traditionally attributed to Tosa Mitsumochi (active 1525–ca. 1559) Period: Momoyama (1573–1615)– Edo (1615–1868) period Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Six-panel folding screen; ink, color, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: 65 3/4 in. × 12 ft. 3 1/2 in.

45214.jpg	Tagasode (“Whose Sleeves?”)		Japan	first half of 17th century	In classical love poetry the phrase Tagasode (“Whose Sleeves?”) refers to an absent woman whose beautiful robes evoke memories of their owner. A number of screens bearing this sobriquet depict sumptuously patterned kimonos draped over lacquered clothing stands. This example displays fashionable textile patterns of the late sixteenth through early seventeenth century. Some of the robes have delicate tie-dyed patterns (“fawn spots,” or kanoko shibori), representing the refinement of Kyoto taste. Beginning in the medieval period, Kyoto was known for its textile industry, centered in what is now the Nishijin district. Empress Consort Tōfukumon’in (1607–1678), wife of Emperor Go-Mizunoo (1596–1680), frequently ordered richly ornamented garments from Kariganeya, a textile shop catering to the old aristocracy, and her purchases initiated official imperial patronage of Kyoto textiles.These screens were recently rebuilt and restored in the Department of Asian Art’s conservation studio with funding from Patricia Saigo and others.	誰ヶ袖図屏風 Title: Tagasode (“Whose Sleeves?”) Period: Momoyama (1573–1615) or Edo (1615–1868) period Date: first half of 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold, silver, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Overall (each screen): 59 1/4 x 10 ft. 10 11/16 in.

45377.jpg	Imperial Carts (Gosho guruma)		Japan	mid-17th century	In ancient and medieval Kyoto, the imperial family and nobility rode in carriages drawn by oxen. In this depiction of three carriages, lowered bamboo blinds tantalizingly suggest the presence of an elegant lady or nobleman. This image alludes to several classic literary scenes, among them an event from the “Leaves of Wild Ginger” (Aoi) chapter in The Tale of Genji, in which attendants of Genji’s wife and his former lover create a crush of carts as they compete for the best position from which to view the Kamo festival in Kyoto. Such beautifully appointed vehicles, decorated with a wild ginger motif, were a popular subject for decorative art objects and textiles. Lacking evidence of a dispute, the composition is a decorative representation of carts set among the delicate pink blossoms of early summer. The painting convention of omitting human presence, common in the decorative arts, came to be called the “motif of absence” (rusu moyō).	御所車図 Title: Imperial Carts (Gosho guruma) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Six-panel folding screen; ink, color, gold, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: 65 3/4 in. × 12 ft. 4 1/2 in.

48990.jpg	Landscapes in Summer and Winter	Ike no Taiga	Japanese	18th century	These paired images function as contrasting emblems of winter and summer. Fiat horizontal lines suggest quiet, dormant winter and the forlorn boat elicits a shiver of sympathy from the viewer. Summer, on the other hand, is filled with color and cheer; the forms of rocks and foliage seem to tumble over one another, giving the whole mountain a sense of growth and energy. This diptych represents two activities that personified the ideal literati life. The winter scene depicts fishing from a boat, a pastime appreciated in the literati tradition as a humble means of experiencing nature, a Taoist ideal of daily life. The summer scene depicts the visit of a friend. Taiga enlivens both of these scenes with a strong narrative feel. Particularly in the summer scene, he engages our attention by suggesting, for example, that the friends might climb up the mountain to the viewing deck to enjoy the scenery. To highlight such narrative moments, he judiciously uses accents of bright red.

The application of gold leaf to the reverse side of the silk lends the paintings a subtle glow and a sense of depth and weight. The chrysanthemum and cotton rose on the right represent autumn, and on the left, the sasanqua, narcissus, and withered reeds symbolize winter. Another screen, featuring spring and summer scenes in a similar format but with silver instead of gold-leaf framing, once accompanied this one but is now in a private American collection. Kano Chikanobu, the leading Kano-school painter in eighteenth-century Edo, was particularly accomplished in bird-and-flower compositions.	狩野周信筆 秋冬花鳥図屏風 Title: Birds and Flowers of Autumn and Winter Artist: Kano Chikanobu (Japanese, 1660–1728) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Six-panel folding screen; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 61 1/8 in. × 11 ft. 7 3/4 in.

44886.jpg	Mandala of the One-Syllable Golden Wheel		Japan	18th century	The Mandala of the One-Syllable Golden Wheel (Japanese: Ichiji Kinrin Mandara) envisions the power of a single Sanskrit syllable, the utterance of which calls forth a personification of the cranial protuberance of the Buddha. It is used in rituals for the prevention of disaster, for the expansion of wealth, and for success in love, as well as for assuring safe delivery of children, career success, and propitious weather. The figural representation of the sound sits at the center of the mandala on a lotus pedestal borne by eight lions. It resembles the Buddha Dainichi (Sanskrit: Vairochana) and holds its hands in a sacred gesture known as the wisdom-fist mudra, which symbolizes the non-duality of perfect wisdom and the deluded nature of unenlightened beings. The surrounding figures and forms represent the seven emblems of sovereignty of supreme rulers and the deity Butsugen Butsumo, literally “Buddha-eye, Buddha-mother,” who crushes ignorance and perceives the essence of all things. Use of costly materials and meticulous craftsmanship, especially in the simulated brocade of the mounting and the intricate cut-gold-leaf-on-azurite of the mountain, reflect a belief in the meritorious nature of image making and the ornamentation of ritual space.	一字金輪曼荼羅 Title: Mandala of the One-Syllable Golden Wheel Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: 44 1/4 x 39 1/4 in.

45262.jpg	The Plains of Musashi		Japan	17th century	A full moon, once silver but now blackened by age, appears on an unobstructed horizon between a background of golden clouds and a foreground frieze of grasses and autumnal wildflowers: yellow maidenflower, blue and white Chinese bellflower, purple agrimony, and wild chrysanthemum. A queue of descending geese (perhaps a later addition) at upper right conveys the vastness of the grassy plain. These pictorial motifs are associated with the once-wild plain of Musashi, now a densely populated area of North Tokyo. Since the tenth century, Musashi has usually been associated with autumn. The tradition underlying this image began in a poem by Minamoto no Michikata (1189–1238):Musashino wa tsuki no irubeki mine mo nashi obana ga sue ni kakaru shirakumoThe plains of Musashihave no mountain peaks into which the moon can slip, as white clouds enshroud spears of plume grasses. —Trans.

45082.jpg	View of West Lake	Kusumi Morikage	Japanese	mid-to-late 17th century	Several major Chan (Japanese: Zen) temples and other places with cultural and historical associations were located on West Lake, on the outskirts of China's Southern Song capital of Hangzhou. Even after the decline of the Song dynasty, the area around the lake remained a symbol of great cultural achievement. On this set of screens, West Lake appears in panorama, as if seen from an observation tower on the city wall along the bottom edge. Ten views of well-known sites in different seasons are distributed within the sweeping view. Kusumi Morikage, a disciple of Kano Tan’yū (1602–1672), official painter to the shogunate, is said to have left the Kano school for unknown reasons. This pair of screens is not dated, but its mild, clear features suggest that Morikage painted it early in his career, before developing his more idiosyncratic style.	久隅守景筆 西湖図屏風 Title: View of West Lake Artist: Kusumi Morikage (ca. 1620–1690) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-to-late 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink and color on paper Dimensions: .1: 68 3/4 in. × 12 ft. 2 3/8 in.

45744.jpg	Autumn Grasses		Japan	first half of the 17th century	Gardens planted to evoke deserted fields of autumn wildflowers inspired poets and artists in many media: painting, ceramics, lacquer, and textiles. Eulalia and Japanese bush clover were the most appreciated of the autumn plants for their appearance of wildness and abundance when waving in the wind, as well as for their suggestion of melancholy when withered.Many screens similar to this pair have been attributed to the Hasegawa school, founded by Hasegawa Tōhaku (1539–1610). The highly dramatic depiction of the grasses—with their rhythmic arrangement into clumps and sharp angling at the bottom to hint at a recession into space—suggests that the screens were produced by a Hasegawa painter in the first half of the seventeenth century. To create their signature mode of representation, Hasegawa artists made determined efforts to assimilate all available techniques of painting, from the famed Tosa-school style to methods used by artists employed by ready-to-sell painting shops. They and their patrons especially favored the subject of autumn grasses.

44858.jpg	Old Plum	Kano Sansetsu	Japanese	1646	The massive black trunk of an ancient plum tree with bending, twisting branches spans nearly sixteen feet across four sliding panels. The reptilian old tree sprouts blossoms, which convey the atmosphere of a cold early spring morning and symbolize birth and renewal. These panels originally formed one wall of a room in the Tenshōin, a subtemple of Myōshinji, a Zen temple in Kyoto. During the 1880s, they were sold to a private collector and trimmed at the top to conform to the smaller dimensions of his home. On the reverse of these panels was a composition depicting the Chinese theme of the Eight Daoist Immortals, which formed a wall in the adjacent room. This composition was later separated and remounted, and it is now in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.	老梅図襖 Title: Old Plum Artist: Kano Sansetsu (Japanese, 1590–1651) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1646 Culture: Japan Medium: Four sliding-door panels (fusuma); ink, color, gold, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Overall (of all four panels): 68 3/4 x 191 1/8 in.

45264.jpg	Bugaku Dances (front); Chinese Lions (reverse)	Hanabusa Itchō	Japanese	early 18th century	Bugaku DancesIllustrated scrolls recording the costumes and gestures of ancient court dances inspired the popular Edo theme drawn from the colorful and exotic bugaku repertory—one of the many appropriations of classic imagery that provided a rich source for the bold design innovations of late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Japanese artists. In this work, painted in Itchō’s later years, the figures seem to dance within and against the gold surface.Chinese Lions (Karajishi)Across the gold expanse of the reverse side of this pair of screens, nine Chinese lions (karajishi) gambol and playfully wrestle. Chinese lions were auspicious symbols of power in East Asian visual culture, and through the Momoyama and Edo periods times were frequently found on screens or sliding-door panels in elite samurai residences, castles, or temples. The dynamic brushwork, whether the jagged curves in dark ink, or the swirls of tails and in grayish tones, reveal the artist Hanabusa Itchō at the height of his artistic powers in his later years—after his return from exile in 1709 (apparently for disreputable behavior with samurai ladies). On the reverse side is a colorful depiction of bugaku (court dance) performances, in a hyper-meticulous but very traditional mode. This set of screens, revealing two sides of Itchō’s stylistic capabilities, is said to be the artist’s most expensive commission, possibly for one of his top patrons in 1713.	舞楽図屏風 ・唐獅子図屏風 Title: Bugaku Dances (front); Chinese Lions (reverse) Artist: Hanabusa Itchō (Japanese, 1652–1724) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel screens; ink, color, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image: 65 1/8 in. × 14 ft. 2 5/8 in.

44861.jpg	Poem by Kamo no Chōmei with Underpainting of Cherry Blossoms	Calligraphy by Hon'ami Kōetsu	Japanese	dated 1606	Nagamureba ni mono omou aki ni mata waga mi hitotsu no mine no matsu kaze Gazing into the distance,in a melancholy autumn mood,is it for me alone that windshowl through boughs of pineson that solitary peak? —Trans. John T. Carpenter This poem page is one of the earliest verifiable works by the influential calligrapher Hon’ami Kōetsu. The poem, included in the anthology New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems (Shin kokin wakashū), is by the monk-poet Kamo no Chōmei (1153–1216), who was famous for his poems on cherry blossoms. Kōetsu and Tawaraya Sōtatsu produced many similar works on both individual sheets and handscrolls. Rarely do background motifs have any semantic or symbolic connection to the poems they accompany. Here, however, Kōetsu responded with élan to the decorated handscrolls and shikishi that Sōtatsu’s studio presented him to write upon.	本阿見光悦書・俵屋宗達下絵 桜下絵和歌色紙 鴨長明 Title: Poem by Kamo no Chōmei with Underpainting of Cherry Blossoms Artist: Calligraphy by Hon'ami Kōetsu (Japanese, 1558–1637) Artist: Underpainting attributed to Tawaraya Sōtatsu (Japanese, ca. 1570–ca. 1640) Period: Momoyama period (1573–1615) Date: dated 1606 Culture: Japan Medium: Poem card (shikishi) mounted as a hanging scroll; ink, gold, and silver on paper Dimensions: Overall: 7 15/16 x 7in.

48923.jpg	Moon and Autumn Grasses	Studio of Tawaraya Sōtatsu	Japanese	mid- to late 17th century	A large half-moon, once silver but now darkly oxidized, shines over a field of delicate autumn grasses. Tiny grains of gold are scattered throughout, and are especially dense around the moon. Since the Heian period (794–1185), the moon over an autumn field has been a favorite subject in Japan, with its stirring evocation of serenity, clarity, and nostalgia. Rinpa artists and members of the more traditional schools, such as Kano and Tosa, favored this subject during the first half of the seventeenth century. Here, the moon floating over the field creates a simple pattern.The signature in the lower right corner reads “Sōtatsu Hokkyō” (Sōtatsu holding the title of Bridge of the Law), and the seal reads “Taiseiken.”	俵屋宗達工房 月に秋草図屏風 Title: Moon and Autumn Grasses Artist: Studio of Tawaraya Sōtatsu (Japanese, ca. 1570–ca. 1640) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid- to late 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, silver, and gold flecks on paper Dimensions: Overall (each screen): 59 7/16 in. x 11 ft. 10 3/8 in.

44896.jpg	Cranes, Pines, and Bamboo	Ogata Kōrin	Japanese	early 18th century	Such propitious symbols of longevity as cranes, pines, and bamboo, shown here beneath a crescent moon, evoke the auspicious realm of the immortals. The pair subtly suggests spring and autumn through such floral motifs as azaleas, chrysanthemums, morning glories, and eulalias. The screens’ most striking feature is the disposition of the stream. Flowing toward the viewer, the stream both separates and unites the two segments of land. Such a bold composition is an early demonstration of Kōrin’s genius for pictorial design, in which natural elements are formalized.Certain unfinished areas suggest the preparatory nature of this work: the smudged-in upper portion of the tree trunk, the faint green of the branches in the right screen, and the notation “very pale green” written on the lower part of the left screen. Thought to have been part of the collection of sketches and drawings formerly owned by the Konishi family, descendants of Ogata Kōrin, this work was later remounted as a pair of folding screens.	尾形光琳筆 松竹に鶴図屏風 Title: Cranes, Pines, and Bamboo Artist: Ogata Kōrin (Japanese, 1658–1716) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of folding screens; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image (Right screen (4-panel)): 65 3/4 in. × 8 ft. 5 1/4 in.

Combined with pampas grass, Chinese bellflowers succinctly express the moment when late summer passes into autumn. Although the painting bears a seal reading "Hokkyō Kōrin" ("Kōrin, holding the rank of Hokkyō"), it lacks the spontaneity of the great genius of the Rinpa style and thus may be assigned to one of Kōrin's numerous followers.

He is best known for his ceramic wares, having studied with the great Kyoto potter Nonomura Ninsei (active ca. 1646–94), but he was also a gifted painter and calligrapher. He took these poems from the Shūigusō (Gleaning of Worthless Weeds), a collection of verse by the poet and calligrapher Fujiwara no Teika (1162–1241). They read: Robes of white clothshould be aired out, they say,just when summer arrivesand deutzia flowers in bloomcause the hedge to droop.In the village of Shinobuwhere the cuckoo dwells,its cry is now heard,while we await next monthwhen deutzia flowers bloom.	尾形乾山筆 定家詠十二ヶ月和歌 花鳥図 『拾遺愚草』 より四月 Title: “Fourth Month” from Fujiwara no Teika’s “Birds and Flowers of the Twelve Months” Artist: Ogata Kenzan (Japanese, 1663–1743) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1743 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 6 5/16 x 8 15/16 in.

For the sixth month the poems celebrate tokonatsu (wild pinks) and the cormorant, a bird used for night fishing, a familiar sight on the waterways of Kyoto where iron fire baskets were suspended from the prows of fishing boats. The poems read:Even though most peopledread the sixth month since the sun is so bright,if wild pinks are in bloom then it does have its charms.On these short nights, flames in iron baskets on cormorant fishing boats pass by quickly and light up the sky of the sixth month.Even though most people dread the sixth month since the sun is so bright,if wild pinks are in bloom then it does have its charms.On these short nights, flames in iron baskets on cormorant fishing boats pass by quickly and light up the sky of the sixth month.	尾形乾山筆 定家詠十二ヶ月和歌 花鳥図 『拾遺愚草』 より六月 Title: “Sixth Month” from Fujiwara no Teika’s “Birds and Flowers of the Twelve Months” Artist: Ogata Kenzan (Japanese, 1663–1743) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1743 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 6 1/4 x 9 1/8 in.

Instead of depending on images from copybooks for inspiration, Maruyama Ōkyo, founder of the Maruyama-Shijo school and proponent of naturalism in painting, practiced sketching from life.

45234.jpg	Miscellaneous Paintings and Calligraphy	Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪	Japanese	second month, 1785	Painting and poetry have long been revered as sister arts in the East Asian cultural tradition. Painters have sought inspiration in poetry, while poets have inscribed their work on paintings. For instance, here ink paintings by the independent artist Rosetsu were attached as separate sheets to screens and complemented on the right screen by two classic Ming-dynasty poems composed by Li Panlong (1514–1570) and Wang Shizhen (1526–1590), along with a Tang-dynasty poem by Men Haoran (ca. 691–740). On the left screen are two additional Tang poems by Pi Rixiu (834–883), and Gao Shi (ca. 704–765), and a colophon by the monk-calligrapher Shishin Sōgin. The last panel, pasted next to the painting of peonies, has a cyclical date indicating the calligraphy was inscribed in the second month of 1785.Signed by Rosetsu in his early calligraphic style, this pair is the only extant work of a monumental scale dating from the artist’s early career. The calligrapher Shishin Sōgin (or Sōkon) was the eighth abbot of Hantō’in subtemple of Myōshinji, Kyoto, in the lineage of Hakuin Ekaku. He trained Maruyama Ōkyo in Zen and calligraphy, and in return learned painting from the great artist. The calligraphy on these screens was inscribed a year before he died.	書画押絵貼屏風 Title: Miscellaneous Paintings and Calligraphy Artist: Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪 (Japanese, 1754–1799) Calligrapher: Shishin Sōgin 指津宗琅 (Japanese, 1726–1786) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: second month, 1785 Culture: Japan Medium: Sheets with calligraphy and painting attached to a pair of six-panel folding screens; ink on paper Dimensions: Image (each screen): 62 3/8 in. x 11 ft. 7 5/8 in.

Here, the birds are silhouetted in negative white against a background of gray ink wash. Together with Itō Jakuchū (1716–1800) and Soga Shōhaku (1730–1781), Rosetsu was known as one of the “Three Eccentrics” (san kijin) of eighteenth-century Kyoto.

39658.jpg	Landscapes with the Chinese Literati Su Shi and Tao Qian	Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪	Japanese	1795–99	The forbidding precipice painted on the left screen suggests a site on the Yangzi River where the Chinese poet Su Shi, also known as Dongpo (1037–1101), composed his famous “Ode on the Red Cliff.” The gentler scene on the right screen, depicting a scholar and attendants in a hut in a willow grove, is meant to represent the Chinese poet-recluse Tao Qian, or Tao Yuanming (365–472), at his country retreat. The artist seems to have set up an explicit contrast between the two scenes—Su’s forced exile (wild) against Tao’s self-imposed exile (calm). Born to a samurai-class family near the capital, Nagasawa Rosetsu chose the life of a painter, studying in the Kyoto studio of Maruyama Ōkyo (1733–1795). Labeled one of the “Three Eccentrics” of the Edo period, he often exhibited a turbulent, bravura brush style and unconventional treatment of subject matter.	山水唐人物図屏風 Title: Landscapes with the Chinese Literati Su Shi and Tao Qian Artist: Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪 (Japanese, 1754–1799) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1795–99 Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each screen): 67 3/8 in. x 12 ft. 2 3/4 in.

49049.jpg	Cherry Blossoms	Matsumura Goshun	Japanese	18th century	Spring breezes suffuse the atmosphere of this realistic yet lyrical vision of fragile blossoms on the branch of an ancient cherry tree. One of the most familiar images in Japanese art, the blossoming cherry has deep roots in Japanese culture. Outings to view the short-lived blossoms were a long-established popular pastime, and this work poignantly captures the effect of a leisurely stroll beneath a cherry tree on a spring afternoon. Although its composition is adapted from the conventional depiction of plum blossoms in Chinese ink paintings, Goshun's painting is notable for the combination of poetic lyricism inspired by haikai verse, learned from his painting and poetry teacher Yosa Buson (1716–1783), with the naturalism and threedimensional effects developed by Maruyama Okyo (1733–1795). In 1782 he adopted the name "Goshun" that appears on this painting, and five years later, in 1787, he took up Okyo as his new mentor. This painting, which still preserves a large measure of Buson's lyricism, should be dated shortly after that date.

45378.jpg	Portrait of the Ōbaku Zen Monk Jifei Ruyi (Sokuhi Nyoitsu)	Kita Genki	Japanese	1666	Genki, a Nagasaki artist, painted this portrait of the Ōbaku master Jifei Ruyi (Japanese Sokuhi Nyoitsu), which was inscribed in Chinese by the subject himself while he was resident at Fukujuji, a temple patronized by the daimyo of Kokura (present-day Kita Kyushu Kitakyūshū). The port of Nagasaki was one of the few places under the tightly regulated Tokugawa government where contemporary Chinese culture and learning could be openly discussed and studied. In the mid-seventeenth century, new ideas on Confucianism and Zen (Chinese: Chan) Buddhism were brought to Japan by Chinese monks travelling through Nagasaki (including Jifei Ruyi) and by envoys from Korea. These monks formed what was known in Japan as the Ōbaku school, after the Japanese rendering of the name of the Tang dynasty monk Huangbo Xiyun (d. 850).There are several versions of this portrait, each with a different inscription. In Zen, the teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni are transmitted directly from teacher to pupil; in seventeenth-century practice, as in earlier ages, the Buddha's word lived in receiving instruction rather than in reading texts. A portrait of one's teacher, suitably inscribed, was a venerated symbol of accomplishment and a tangible reminder of the special relationship around which knowledge was structured. Since the Kamakura period (1185–1333), portraiture and inscriptions have merged religion, autobiography, and biography in images of great power, as in this hanging scroll.

At left, the fluid and elongated cursive calligraphy of the Chinese Ōbaku Zen monk Jifei Ruyi suggests that the wisdom the monk seeks in the sutra resides elsewhere.

49068.jpg	Bamboo in Snow	Taihō Shōkon	Chinese	1774	The interplay of word and image is a firmly established Chinese tradition that Japanese artists have also cultivated. Taihō, who twice served as abbot of the Manpukuji Temple (headquarters of the Ōbaku Zen sect in Kyoto), is noted for his paintings of bamboo. Another Chinese émigré monk and Manpukuji abbot, Hakujun Shōkō, composed the following poem at the age of eighty to accompany Taihō’s painting:Bamboo expands, putting forth bamboo shoots, over thick green leaves.Let a man contemplatethe virtues of bamboo: elegance, strength, and firmness,and purify the roots of his karma.	大鵬正鯤筆 伯珣照浩賛 雪竹図 Title: Bamboo in Snow Artist: Taihō Shōkon (1691–1774) Artist: Calligrapher: Hakujun Shōkō (1695–1776) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1774 Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink on silk Dimensions: Image (each): 47 1/2 in. × 20 in.

49073.jpg	Bird among Camellias in Snow	Sō Shiseki	Japanese		Sō Shiseki, born in Edo (present-day Tokyo), went to the port city of Nagasaki to study with Song Ziyuan, a Chinese artist who taught painting there. His devotion to his master was so profound that he adopted the name Sō Shiseki ("song purple stone"), an explicit reference to sō shigan ("song purple cliff"), the Japanese pronunciation of his teacher's name.After his return to Edo, Sō Shiseki taught a blend of Chinese and Western realism; this style, adopted by his many followers, came to define the Nagasaki school of painting. One of his followers was his son, Sō Shizan, whose work is also shown in this gallery. The principal pictorial elements in Sō Shiseki's paintings are meticulously detailed in brilliant colors against a neutral background, save for some lightly brushed-in wash.

49069.jpg	Pheasant beneath Paulownia Tree	Saien Hōsai (Xiyua Fangqi)	Chinese	18th century	A single pheasant stands upon an outcropping of rocks beneath a paulownia tree whose branch supports a pair of smaller fowl. In this deceptively simple composition, the artist has deployed a wide array of brush techniques. In the pheasant alone the artist has used a dry, controlled brush for the crest; a soft layer of dark, wet ovals over modulated ink wash for the breast; crisp, opaque strokes for the legs and feet; and diminutive dots over translucent sweeps of ink for the back and tail feathers. Xiyua Fangqi, known in Japan as Saien Hōsai, was a Chinese merchant and painter. He is thought to have been from either Jiangsu or Anhui Province, and to have traveled to Japan on a number of occasions beginning about the year 1772.	西園方済筆 梧桐下錦鶏図 Title: Pheasant beneath Paulownia Tree Artist: Saien Hōsai (Xiyua Fangqi) (1736?–?1795) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: 38 1/2 x 12 3/16 in.

In his subject matter, the artist has followed models set forth in Ming-dynasty Chinese painting. His brushwork is characterized by a spirited roughness and the liberal use of thick ink to create dynamic contrasts, which brings a remarkable sense of volume to both branch and bird. Xiyua Fangqi, known in Japan as Saien Hōsai, was a Qing-dynasty Chinese merchant and painter. He was thought to have been from either Jiangsu or Anhui Province, and to have traveled to Japan on a number of occasions beginning about the year 1772. One story says that he once drifted ashore in what is today Chiba Prefecture, in eastern Japan, and along the way to Nagasaki he saw and painted Mount Fuji. He is said to have brought the painting back to China, where it generated much interest.	西園方済筆 梅に叭叭鳥図 Title: Mynah Bird on Plum Branch Artist: Saien Hōsai (Xiyua Fangqi) (1736?–?1795) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: 36 3/16 x 10 1/2 in.

48988.jpg	Bamboo and Rock in Snow	Sakaki Hyakusen	Japanese	1750	Bamboo, a symbol of enduring strength—able to bend in the wind without breaking and to withstand the onslaught of winter—was a favored painting theme among the literati in East Asia. Here, stems of bamboo, bowing under the weight of snow on their slender leaves, emerge from behind a mossy boulder. To represent the snow, Sakaki Hyakusen left areas of the paper unpainted, while his uneven application of gray wash evokes a dark, wintry evening. An assiduous student of the Chinese tradition through imported painting manuals, Sakaki is regarded as one of the pioneers of literati painting and an inspiration to many subsequent generations.	彭城百川筆 雪竹図 Title: Bamboo and Rock in Snow Artist: Sakaki Hyakusen (Japanese, 1697–1752) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1750 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 53 1/8 x 16in.

48994.jpg	Autumnal Landscape with a Waterfall	Ike (Tokuyama) Gyokuran	Japanese	second half of the 18th century	Ike Gyokuran was one of the best-known women artists of the Edo period. She grew up in Kyoto, where her family owned a tea shop and her mother and adoptive grandmother published waka poetry. Later, Gyokuran and her husband, the influential and prolific Nanga (literati) painter Ike Taiga (1723–1776), built their home and studio by Gion Shrine, east of Kyoto’s Kamo River. In this painting of an autumn landscape with crystalline foreground rocks before a background waterfall, the artist combines soft brush lines and angular, darkly inked, calligraphic strokes. Abundant short blue-green marks and pink dots indicate evergreen trees alongside the maples and other deciduous trees changing color in the mountains.	池(徳山)玉瀾筆 秋山水図扇面 Title: Autumnal Landscape with a Waterfall Artist: Ike (Tokuyama) Gyokuran (Japanese, 1728–1784) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: second half of the 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Fan mounted as a hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 7 1/2 x 20 9/16 in.

48995.jpg	Birds in Willows and Blossoming Peach Tree	Yosa Buson	Japanese		Buson’s painting style translates Chinese motifs and styles into a softer, freer expression of Japanese taste. Thus, while the compositional elements here are based upon authoritative Ming and Qing prototypes, the artist executed features of the natural world with looser brushstrokes in more subdued tones. Buson gave a witty personal expression to this work, which is based on conventional Qing-dynasty painting. He juxtaposes the two birds so that the female, on the bough above, seems to peer with a critical eye at her mate below, who is self-absorbed in the joy of his own song.	与謝蕪村筆 柳緑桃紅図 Title: Birds in Willows and Blossoming Peach Tree Artist: Yosa Buson (Japanese, 1716–1783) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: 51 1/2 × 24 5/8 in.

45340.jpg	The Poet Mibu no Tadamine, from a set of album leaves illustrating The Thirty-six Poetic Immortals	Iwasa Matabei	Japanese	early 17th century	For the Japanese elite, poetry was the quintessential literary experience. Idealized and deeply admired, poets were often commemorated in portraiture. In the early eleventh century, Fujiwara Kintō (966–1041) selected thirty-six "immortal" poets from the past, and their images became a popular theme in the yamato-e painting tradition. This picture, originally part of a set of album leaves of the thirty-six poets, is attributed to Iwasa Matabei (1578–1650), a renowned painter who is often credited with originating ukiyo-e genre painting. Portrayed is the poet Mibu no Tadamine (act. ca. 910), accompanied by his famous poem of spring: Is it just because They say this is the day which marks The coming of spring that the mountains Of fair Yoshino are veiled this morning in haze? —trans.

The setting, sketched lightly in ink, is Suma's desolate shore, but the colorful protagonists are characteristic of the "floating world" of Edo's pleasure quarter. Here, the sisters' lover, Yukihira, is portrayed as an urban bon vivant and affects a stylish nonchalance. His flashy robe is patterned with the bamboo blinds of a well-appointed room and features crests of a courtier's cap, furthering the playful fantasy of the Edo townsman as aristocratic lover. A striped jacket and hat, typical of an Edo dandy, are draped on the tree in the background, recalling the fabled pine at Suma where Yukihira once left a robe and cap as parting gifts.

45790.jpg	Fukurokuju	Katsukawa Shunshō 勝川春章	Japanese	1798	Another auspicious symbol for the New Year, Fukurokuju embodied both wisdom and long life in his truncated body and elongated head, carrying a sutra scroll from his walking stick. The Seven Gods of Good Fortune were very popular objects of worship among merchants in Edo and Osaka society. This immortal was also considered the personification of the south pole star in Chinese astrology.Katsukawa Shunshō was a major ukiyo-e painter and print designer active in the latter half of the eighteenth century; a painting of Fukurokuju seems a departure from his usual subjects of beauties and actors. Most likely done late in his life, this hanging scroll painted in an eccentric, bravura ink style must have had personal meaning and may have been created in the company of friends. The inscription on the top, which postdates the painting, is by the kyōka poet Tegara no Okamochi (1734–1812), who is best known for a poem on old age titled Year's End:Toshi nami no yo suru hitai noshiwami yori kururu wa itakuoshimare ni keri.Mistaking the many years breakingacross one's forehead in wrinklesfor waves against theshore we suddenly feel deeply ourown regrets at their passing.

Written on either side of the image is a text, now partly abraded, which once read:This ema is respectfully presented to the deity on the twenty-fifth day of the third month of the year 1627.Squeezed beneath the lion’s back legs are the (partially illegible) names of four donors. The two names which can be read in their entirety are Gorōsuke and Sanzō. The location of their residence, Nabeyachō, an area only a short distance from the Kōfukuji Temple, appears between the lion’s front legs. The back of the ema has another inscription, now also difficult to make out, which refers to Monju and his wisdom.	優闐王と唐獅子図絵馬「奉掛御宝前 絵馬 寛永丁卯年三月廿五日」 Title: Ema (Votive Painting) of Chinese Lion Led by Utenō Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: dated 1627 Culture: Japan Medium: Ink and color on wood Dimensions: 10 3/4 x 14 3/8 in.

36111.jpg	Ōtsu-e of Shōmen Kongōyasha (Vajrayaksha)		Japan	17th century	In the Edo period, images of the fierce blue-bodied deity Shōmen Kongōyasha served as the central icon for the popular rite of kōshin machi (or konoesaru machi), an all-night gathering occurring once every sixty days. In a conflation of Daoist and Buddhist beliefs, Kongōyasha presided over this gathering on the night when three worms said to reside in the human body escaped during one’s sleep to report on transgressions to the heavenly deity Taishakuten. People stayed up together to prevent the worms’ ability to leave their bodies and inform on them, thereby avoiding having their lives shortened on the basis of unfavorable reports.The earlier of the two Ōtsu-e is closer in form to standard painted Buddhist icons, although more simple in execution. In accordance with descriptions in sacred texts, two attendants stand to the left and right of Kongōyasha, who stands upon two demons, while before him are four fierce yasha (Sanskrit: yaksha), wielding a variety of weapons. In the later, simplified version, Kongōyasha stands on a rock, flanked by two monkeys. The monkeys, who replace the attendant figures in earlier versions of the iconography, relate to the saru of konoesaru, indicating days of the sexagenary calendar associated with the monkey, or saru in Japanese. They also represent the avoidance of evil, a main goal of the all-night vigil. In front of Kongōyasha are a rooster and hen, both woodblock printed, possibly a reminder that people born in the year of the bird looked to Fudō Myōō, to which Kogōyashi is closely connected, as their protective deity.	金剛夜叉図大津絵 Title: Ōtsu-e of Shōmen Kongōyasha (Vajrayaksha) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and hand-colored woodblock print on paper Dimensions: Image: 23 x 9 1/8 in.

36112.jpg	Ōtsu-e of Thirteen Buddhist Deities		Japan	17th century	The image of Thirteen Buddhist Deities was hung for memorials for the deceased held at fixed intervals over the days and years after death. Originally, a series of paintings depicting the deities individually was used, but this image combines them into one icon that could be employed repeatedly by less affluent families. The deities’ halos and mandorlas are woodblock printed with the same block, while a limited number of different blocks were used to give a measure of variety to the faces. The same block, for example, used for the head of the bodhisattva Jizō (Sanskrit: Kshitigarbha) was used for that of the King of Brightness, Fudō (Sanskrit: Achala) such that the latter loses his typically fierce countenance.	十三仏図大津絵 Title: Ōtsu-e of Thirteen Buddhist Deities Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and woodblock print on paper Dimensions: Image: 13 1/4 x 6 7/8 in.

36115.jpg	Ōtsu-e of Kabuki Actor Playing Hotei Ichiemon		Japan	early 18th century	This Ōtsu-e has an interesting history. On the reverse of the scroll is brushed what one person determined the subject of the work to be—Hotei Ichiemon, one of a gang of five thieves and marauders known as the Gold Hunting Five (Karigane Gonin Otoko), who occupied Osaka for a time before being apprehended and then executed in 1702. The same person also wrote that the porcelain roller ends were produced by the famed potter Hamada Shōji and the mounting made by Yanagi Sōsetsu, the godfather of the Mingei movement, and author of a text on Ōtsu-e. Puppet shows and Kabuki plays based on the Gold Hunting Five were very popular and frequently represented in actor prints, the likely inspiration for this image.	布袋市右衛門図大津絵 Title: Ōtsu-e of Kabuki Actor Playing Hotei Ichiemon Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; hand-colored woodblock print on paper Dimensions: Image: 17 15/16 x 8 1/4 in.

45376.jpg	Tartars Playing Polo	Kano Eisen'in Furunobu 狩野永川院古	Japanese	early 18th century	Along with hunting, polo exercised great appeal as a subject for poets, painters, and craftsmen in ancient China. During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, hundreds of years after the sport's decline in the region, polo made a sudden reappearance as a subject for painting in Japan. The burgeoning warrior class favored such ancient themes as Tartars playing polo and Tartars hunting for decorations in their new castles and mansions.Unlike the grand-scale Momoyama (1573–1615) screen paintings on sumptuous gold backgrounds, this work is quite modest in its execution. The landscape details that usually accompanied Momoyama polo scenes are absent, so that the equestrians, captured as they strike characteristic polo postures, seem like quick studies of pure form.

40462.jpg	Bean Vine	Itō Jakuchū	Japanese	mid-18th century	Itō Jakuchū, son of a greengrocer, used vegetables and plants as a personal iconography that almost always included a moral or religious meaning. This handsome sketch of a bean plant, paired with a poem by Ōbaku Zen monk Musen Jōzen (Tangai), refers to a story about the Chinese poet Cao Zhi (192–232), whose tyrannical brother, Cao Pei (Emperor Wen), once commanded him to compose a poem before he took seven steps, threatening him with execution if he failed. Tangai’s verse makes an erudite reference to Cao Zhi’s original poem comparing himself and his brother to the parts of a bean plant, while also alluding to the Zen philosophy of nonduality. The green vine puts forth blossoms, and its pods are like half-formed swords. The bean and stalk are inseparable; both were born from the same roots. —Trans. John T.

49075.jpg	Birds and Flowers	Sō Shiseki	Japanese	18th century	Sō Shiseki, a leading painter of the Nagasaki school in Edo (modern Tokyo) went to Nagasaki to study with Song Ziyuan, a Chinese artist who taught painting in that port city. Sō also studied with another Chinese painter, Shen Nanpin (Shen Quan, 1682–1758), who established the Nagasaki school, characterized by brightly colored, realistic images of birds and flowers, in the early 1730s. After returning to Edo (modern Tokyo), Sō Shiseki fostered the Nagasaki school there, teaching a blend of Chinese and Western realism to his students, including his son, Sō Shizan, whose work is also shown in this gallery.The composition features a pair of birds perched on a long branch that stretches diagonally across the scroll. The birds are intimately connected: one looks down, the other up. Both birds and flowers are meticulously and vividly rendered in color, exemplars of the Nagasaki-school style.

44762.jpg	Tiger	Meisō	Japanese	early 18th century	The tiger has long been an auspicious symbol of power throughout Asia, in both popular culture and elite society. In East Asian art a tiger in a bamboo grove conveys the idea of a peaceful and harmonious society, strong leadership, and just government, as it is one of the few animals able to navigate the thick bamboo forest. With its almost whimsical treatment of the animal, this work resembles Korean tiger paintings of the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910); however, the loose, free brushwork is more characteristic of Japanese renditions of the subject. The artist, Meisō, was almost certainly a Japanese monk-painter. An eighteenth-century monk named Shitaku Junka, about whom little is known, composed the inscribed poem.	明窓筆 虎図 Title: Tiger Artist: Meisō (Japanese, active early 18th century) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 30 5/8 x 13 3/8 in.

44602.jpg	Welcoming Descent of Amida Buddha and Twenty-five Bodhisattvas		Japan	1668	According to Pure Land Buddhist belief, Amida Buddha (Amitabha) welcomes devotees to his paradise, the Western Pure Land, where they can achieve perfect spiritual development. Paintings such as this one, which represent Amida descending to meet the faithful at the moment of death, attended by a host of bodhisattvas, are known as raigō-zu ("welcoming descent pictures"). According to the inscription on the back of this work, it was commissioned by Oikawa Zen'emon, a resident of the eastern outskirts of the capital of Edo (now Tokyo), to commemorate his wife's death in 1668. She is depicted in the lower right corner, being received by the holy retinue, which will transport her to the Pure Land. The inscription suggests that both knobs of the scroll's lower roller bar contain cremated human remains, including those of Mrs. Oikawa. The metal roller knobs are designed with small windows that allow visual access to the relics.	阿弥陀二十五菩薩来迎図 Title: Welcoming Descent of Amida Buddha and Twenty-five Bodhisattvas Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1668 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 51 1/8 x 24 1/4 in.

44627.jpg	Courtesans		Japan		Japan's rich native culture was thrown back on its own resources when, from the early seventeenth century, the Tokugawa shogunate closed the country off to the outside world for more than two hundred years. But in the rare painted figures of the Kan'ei era there is an animation and a degree of realism in the representation of the female body that may reflect Western influences and that tells of a highly creative phase in the culture of a country now stable and prosperous. Figures were soon to become more static.The subjects of this screen are elite courtesans, and they are individualized both by their languorous body language and by their clothing. Their faces are only minimally decribed. One parades in her finery, waited on by an alert young attendant; while two others enjoy reading a scroll, perhaps a "morning after" letter from a lover.

40022.jpg	Eight Views of Ōmi (Ōmi hakkei)	Soga Shōhaku	Japanese	ca. 1762–66	Soga Shōhaku was a prominent, if eccentric, figure in Kyoto during the second half of the eighteenth century, when he developed the style that set him apart from painters of the Kano, Nanga, and Shijō schools. Here, he has depicted the standard ink landscape theme of Eight Views, but with a local twist. This screen, the left of a pair, shows four of the Eight Views of Ōmi. Each of the moments celebrated in the Chinese theme has been matched with a place and season from the area of Lake Biwa, Japan's largest and most fabled lake, just east of the mountains that form the eastern border of the ancient capital at Kyoto. His contemporary and local interpretation is rendered in a style of ink painting that knowingly refers to the work of painters of the Soga school, who were active during the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Conspicuous on the right is the Ishiyamadera, the hillside temple where the author of The Tale of Genji is said to have been moved to write her compelling portrait of court life by the sight of the full moon reflected on the lake.	近江八景 Title: Eight Views of Ōmi (Ōmi hakkei) Artist: Soga Shōhaku (Japanese, 1730–1781) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1762–66 Culture: Japan Medium: Six-panel folding screen; ink and paper Dimensions: Image: 46 in. x 13 ft.

In his later years, Tan'yū studiously made copies of the paintings that were brought to him for his judgment. The copies (shukuzu, or "reduced pictures") are indispensable records of the works still extant during his time. Symbolizing Confucian ideals, two gentlemen are engaged in a game of go, one of the Four Gentlemanly Accomplishments, while two observers are in conversation. Three other accomplishments required of learned gentlemen are music, painting, and calligraphy.Tan'yū signed his title hōin and his age as sixty-five.

Nightingales and cuckoos celebrate both seasons. The left-hand screen depicts autumn and winter, represented by hibiscus, snowy bamboo, a kingfisher, and pheasants. Each screen bears two seals of Kano Sanboku. Little is known about Sanboku except that he was a student of both Kano Sanraku (1559–1635) and Kano Sansetsu (1590–1651), the two great masters of the Kano school’s Kyoto branch. His subdued depiction of the four seasons recalls the art of Sansetsu and is almost devoid of color, shunning the exuberance that appealed to the taste of warrior clients of the early Edo period.	狩野山卜筆四季花鳥図屏風 Title: Birds and Flowers of the Four Seasons Artist: Kano Sanboku (Japanese, active mid-17th–early 18th century) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, and gold on paper Dimensions: Image: 59 in. x 12 ft. 1/2 in.

54038.jpg	Rooster in a Storm	Sō Shizan	Japanese	1783	This scroll portrays a rooster in a rainstorm. The artist applied ink with great sensitivity to depict the blown bamboo leaves and strong gusts of wind, and brilliant colors to render the blue morning glories and the magnificent rooster. Flowers and bird alike are completely soaked and disordered. Hunkering down against the storm, the rooster demonstrates an unbreakable determination to endure. At the upper right edge of the painting is the artist’s signature, his age of sixty-one, and his seal, which reads “Shizan.” In the Edo period Shizan was the leading painter of the Nagasaki school, whose style, characterized by realistic, brightly colored images of birds and flowers, was inspired by the Chinese painter Shen Nanpin, who taught painting in Nagasaki from 1731 to 1733.	宋紫山筆 嵐に鶏図 Title: Rooster in a Storm Artist: Sō Shizan (Japanese, 1733–1805) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1783 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 38 5/8 × 17 1/4 in.

In East Asia the arts of poetry, calligraphy, and painting are considered the “three perfections,” and since the ninth century, the Japanese have decorated screens with paintings and poems inscribed in fine calligraphy.Three pairs of shikishi are pasted on each panel: each pair is inscribed with a couplet from a Chinese poem at the right and a waka (a thirty-one-syllable Japanese-style poem) at the left. The poems share common themes such as the four seasons, bamboo, pines, or clouds. The idiosyncratic style of calligraphy, with hooks at the ends of strokes and the tall, elongated profile of the characters, is attributable to the nobleman-calligrapher Konoe Nobuhiro (1599–1649).	伝近衛信尋書・伝長谷川宗也絵 葛下絵色紙貼付 『和漢朗詠集』 屏風 Title: Anthology of Japanese and Chinese Poems (Wakan rōeishū) with Underpainting of Arrowroot Vines Calligrapher: Konoe Nobuhiro (Japanese, 1599–1649) Artist: Underpainting attributed to Hasegawa Sōya (Japanese, born 1590) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Six-panel folding screen; ink and color on gilt paper Dimensions: Image: 65 3/4 in. × 12 ft. 4 in.

Each painting was made on a separate sheet, which were all joined to form a long handscroll.

65670.jpg	Cherry, Plum and Willow Trees	Unidentified artist		early 17th century	Originally the right half of a pair, this screen depicts flowering trees and a budding willow that convey the joyous spirit of spring. It includes three large cherry trees near the center and a slender branch laden with plum blossoms that belongs to a tree originally depicted on the lost left screen. Large cherry and plum blossoms are raised in low relief using gofun (ground seashell pigment). A sinuous willow tree stands in the middle of the composition, with cascading young leaves in pale green. A cluster of small dandelions fills the lower left corner. The slender and gently swaying tree trunks; the grouping of the trees in the center rather than to a side (as is usual in folding screens); and the soft curves of the scalloped edges of the gold clouds all point to an artist working close to Kano Mitsunobu (1565–1608), eldest son of the great Momoyama period master Eitoku (1543–1590).	桜梅柳図屏風 Title: Cherry, Plum and Willow Trees Artist: Unidentified artist Japanese, 17th century Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Single six-panel folding screen; ink, color, gold, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image: 60 3/8 in. × 11 ft. 5 9/16 in.

Contrasting ink tones, from coal black to pearl gray, are united by the watery gray wash.Around 1699 the painter of this small, lyrical landscape helped the legendary Rinpa masters Ogata Kōrin (1658–1716) and his younger brother Kenzan (1663–1743) in their venture into the commercial production of decorated ceramics. Watanabe Shikō, then still a teenager, decorated some of their wares with Kano-style painting. Shikō subsequently created a style of his own, in which he successfully synthesized the academic orthodoxy of the Kano school and the decorative style of Rinpa.	山水図屏風 Title: Landscape Artist: Watanabe Shikō 渡辺始興 (Japanese, 1683–1755) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: first half of the 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Two-panel folding screen; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 59 7/16 × 66 9/16 in.

72600.jpg	One Hundred Chinese Boys		Japan	18th century	A sumptuous estate, including a bridge and pavilion over a lake, is set off by a shimmering gilded background and golden clouds and enlivened by cavorting children. The conventional motif of One Hundred Children has obvious auspicious connotations in the Chinese tradition. Here, the ancient subject is combined with the moralizing theme of the Four Gentlemanly Accomplishments (calligraphy, painting, music, and the game of go), which engage the children. One Hundred Children became one of the most popular themes among the Kano painters, the official artists who worked for the shoguns and their vassals during the Edo period. The anonymous painter of this screen seems to have based it on a readily available model. The dry, mannered execution of the landscape elements points to a date in the eighteenth century for this work.

72742.jpg	Flowering Plants and Vegetables of the Four Seasons		Japan	early 18th century	These screens feature a profusion of flowering plants and vegetables painted with “boneless” brushwork (without outlines) in mineral colors and ink on a gold-leaf ground. They were created by an eighteenth-century follower of the Rinpa style established by Tawaraya Sōtatsu (ca. 1570–ca. 1640).Flowers and flowering grasses of the four seasons, including cotton roses, dandelions, irises, violets, and wild wisteria, are depicted on the right screen; vegetables—such as carrots, corn, eggplants, millet, peas, radishes, and turnips—predominate on the left. Thirty-four flowering plants and thirty-two vegetables have been identified. The broad-leafed vegetation on the left creates a bold visual contrast to the delicate flora on the companion screen. During the eighteenth century, Chinese pharmacology and Western botany drew the attention of Japanese intellectuals not only to plants linked to classical literary traditions but also to domestic flowers and vegetables in their natural environs.	四季花野菜図屏風 Title: Flowering Plants and Vegetables of the Four Seasons Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, light color, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each screen): 64 3/16 in. × 12 ft. 2 7/16 in.

A semihistorical figure, he is believed to have lived in southern China in the late ninth century and was eventually recognized as a manifestation of Miroku, Buddha of the Future. The poetic text here, from a eulogy for Hotei by the Chinese Daoist Bai Yuchan (1194–1229), was inscribed by Tetsuzan Sōdon, a leading monk-scholar who served as abbot of the Zen monastery Myōshinji in Kyoto.Hotei’s sack encompasses the Great Emptiness.

73193.jpg	The Sixth Patriarch of Zen at the Moment of Enlightenment	Kano Tan'yū	Japanese	1635–45	This small image, executed with a few brushstrokes in light ink, is Kano Tan'yū's reiteration of a legendary painting of the early thirteenth century by the renowned Southern Song Chinese painter Liang Kai (now in the Tokyo National Museum). It illustrates a Zen parable regarding Hui-neng (638–713), the sixth patriarch of Zen (Chan in Chinese), who suddenly found enlightenment as he was about to split a bamboo branch for firewood.Tan'yū, the leader of the Kano school painters in Edo, kept copious pictorial records of works that he examined. Here, while clearly inspired by Liang Kai's painting, he skillfully manipulated broad ink washes to indicate the upper and lower parts of the body and eliminated details, leaving much to the viewer's imagination. The painting bears an inscription by Takuan Sōhō (1573–1645), one of the most prominent Zen monks in Japan's history, referring to a single strike of a knife that vanquishes all thoughts. The large seal below the colophon belongs to the Tayasu family, the house of the ninth Tokugawa shogun Ieshige (1711–1761), indicating the painting's previous ownership.

73645.jpg	Bodhidharma Crossing the Yangzi River on a Reed	Kano Genshun 狩野元俊	Japanese	before 1641	Bodhidharma (Japanese: Daruma) was a sixth-century Indian sage who is credited with transmitting Zen Buddhist teachings to China. After an unsuccessful encounter with the Chinese Liang-dynasty Emperor Wu, Bodhidharma is said to have sailed up the Yangzi River on a single reed to continue his journey to promote Zen. Executed in an abbreviated style using only a few long, flowing strokes to define the sage’s robes, this work reflects an ink-painting style that was introduced from China in the late Kamakura period (1185–1333). The colophon above the figure, composed and inscribed by the noted Zen monk Gyokushitsu Sōhaku, reads: Lightly sailing on a single reed, He is majestic and commanding. Far from Liang territory, Ah, what does he recall? Although this painting was previously attributed to the Momoyama-period artist Kano Sōshū (1551–1601), a reevaluation of the seal impressed at lower right has revealed the artist to be Kano Genshun (also called Hayato), a Kano painter of the early Edo period and first head of the minor Yamashita Kano studio.	芦葉達磨図 (Royō Daruma zu) Title: Bodhidharma Crossing the Yangzi River on a Reed Artist: Kano Genshun 狩野元俊 (Japanese, 1588–1672) Artist: Inscription by Gyokushitsu Sōhaku (Japanese, 1572–1641) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: before 1641 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 31 3/4 x 12 3/4 in.

75372.jpg	One Hundred Boys	Kano Einō	Japanese	17th century	The signatures and red intaglio seals appearing at the left- and rightmost corners of these brilliantly painted small-format screens read, respectively, "painted by Kano Nuidonosuke Einō" and "Sansei." The character "San" (mountain) of the "Sansei" seal refers to Einō's father, Sansetsu (ca. 1589–1651), whom he succeeded as the third head of the Kyoto-based branch of the preeminent Kano family workshop. Unarguably the most important family of painters in Japanese history, the House of Kano served as official painters to the imperial and military elite for over four centuries. In addition to excelling in the family style, Einō is widely known as the author of History of Painting in This Realm (Honchō gashi), the first major history of painting written in Japan. His text, based on drafts by his father, was heavily influenced by Chinese histories of the subject, reflecting a continental bias that is also evident in his and other Kano artists' paintings.While the felicitous theme of "One Hundred Boys" first appeared in China during the Song dynasty (960–1279), these screens are indebted to prototypes from the later Ming era (1368–1644), when the subject also appeared widely on ceramics and other decorative arts objects. The detail, variety, and sheer number of figures, executed in fine-quality pigments, along with other features of the screens' construction indicate that the family who commissioned them was aristocratic. They may have belonged to a bride's wedding trousseau, perhaps to inspire the creation of a large and joyous family.	狩野永納筆 唐子遊図屏風 Title: One Hundred Boys Artist: Kano Einō (Japanese, 1631–1697) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, and gold on paper Dimensions: Image (each screen): 44 7/8 in. × 9 ft. 3 in.

76113.jpg	Screens within Screens		Japan	late 17th–early 18th century	This pair of screens is unusual in its subject matter: replicas of folding screens painted on the screens themselves, which offer a fanciful catalogue of workshop styles practiced in Japan in the 1700s. They relate to two categories of decorative motifs seen on screens, one known as “Whose Sleeves?” and the other as “Scattered Fans.” Screens of the first type feature variously patterned kimono draped over lacquer racks; those in the latter category are decorated with fans that have themselves been embellished with pictures. In a nod to the “Scattered Fans” genre, one of the replica screens seen here features fans decorated with a range of motifs, from vegetables and insects to episodes from courtly narratives.	屏風尽図屏風 Title: Screens within Screens Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th–early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, and gold on gilt paper Dimensions: Image (each): 66 15/16 in. × 12 ft. 4 in.

73348.jpg	The God of Good Fortune Jurōjin	Soga Shōhaku	Japanese	ca. 1773	Jurōjin, one of the seven Japanese gods of good fortune, is seated in a small boat with a white deer, his frequent companion. To compound the felicitous imagery, Jurōjin hoists a small minogame (straw-raincoat turtle) into the boat, and above him soars a crane, both symbols of longevity. The “mantle” of the turtle is formed from seaweed and attests to how long the amphibious animal has lived. Jurōjin’s forehead is traditionally depicted as overly large or elongated, emblematic of his wisdom. The accenting of his mouth and lips with bright red, a color associated with the budding of flowers in spring, adds to the celebratory effect of this work, no doubt made for the New Year. The vigorous ink brushwork used to delineate the forms of the tree and stones, including Chinese “axe-cut” strokes, are characteristic of Soga Shōhaku’s work, though here might have been created with the assistance of members of his atelier. The rendering of the facial features and hands of Jurōjin, the representation of the deer, as well as the dynamic curved strokes of the waves, bespeak the brush of the master. The impression of the "Kiichi" seal is one known from other accepted Shōhaku works.	曽我蕭白筆 寿老人図 Title: The God of Good Fortune Jurōjin Artist: Soga Shōhaku (Japanese, 1730–1781) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1773 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 52 3/4 x 22 5/16 in.

77168.jpg	Cranes	Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪	Japanese	late 1780s	This striking diptych of hanging scrolls depicts three Japanese red-crowned cranes (tanchōzuru), with no further landscape setting. With the exception of the signature patch of crimson skin on the crown of the head—painted in brilliant red and adding a vivifying touch—the cranes are rendered entirely in ink. Their poses vary, their bodies delineated through a combination of bold outlining, unpainted space, and gray wash. Nagasawa Rosetsu’s steady hand with the brush is clear, notably in the birds’ sticklike legs, juxtaposed with the ink washes at the ends of their dark feathers. The feet are also carefully placed, as Rosetsu’s mentor Maruyama Ōkyo was known to do in his own paintings of birds. The overall effect is one of surprise and humor, as if we happened upon the birds and caught them posing for the artist—or for us.	鶴図 Title: Cranes Artist: Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪 (Japanese, 1754–1799) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 1780s Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image (each scroll): 61 7/16 x 35 7/8 in.

Behind it a full moon, rendered in reserve, signals that the setting is evening. The owl, with its head turned slightly, stares directly at the viewer, creating an effect that is at once startling and humorous. Painted entirely in ink, the texture of feathers is effectively conveyed through layered brushwork in various tones.

77204.jpg	Waxwings, Cherry Blossoms, and Bamboo	Kiyohara Yukinobu	Japanese	late 17th century	Kiyohara Yukinobu was known in the early Edo period as a “woman highly accomplished in the arts,” or keishū. Her husband was a pupil of Kano Tan’yū, one of the most prominent painters of the age, and she herself, as Tan’yū’s grandniece, may have studied with him. Here, she depicts three waxwings (Japanese: hirenjaku) in various poses: one rests serenely on the branch of an aged cherry tree in full bloom, indicating a late spring setting; one is captured in flight; and the third perches on a rock, espying insect prey in a stream. Since waxwings, after mating, rub their heads together in a way that suggests a display of mutual affection, they came to be a symbol of marital harmony and familial prosperity, which is one possible interpretation of the painting.	清原雪信筆 緋連雀桜竹図 Title: Waxwings, Cherry Blossoms, and Bamboo Artist: Kiyohara Yukinobu (Japanese, 1643–1682) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 39 1/8 x 16 3/8 in.

78221.jpg	Mynah Birds	Unidentified artist		early 17th century	A myriad of mynah birds set against the gold and blue of a shoreline is frozen in a moment in time. Although not native to Japan, within East Asian literary tradition mynah birds serve as emblems of honesty, independent thinking, and even resistance to unjust authority. Whether this work can be interpreted as political protest is impossible to know, but the unusual iconography, focusing on mynah birds to the exclusion of any other creature or even landscape elements, lends itself to such an interpretation. It also dates to an era when Japanese artists were reformulating Chinese modes of ink painting to create their own distinct pictures.	叭々鳥図屏風 Title: Mynah Birds Artist: Unidentified artist Japanese Period: Momoyama (1573–1615) or Edo (1615–1868) period Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, and gold on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 61 in. × 11 ft. 10 1/8 in.

The abbreviated brushwork and suggestive use of blank space were earlier associated with Zen monk painters of medieval times. The Zen monk Fūgai Ekun of the Sōtō sect followed in this tradition, and often inscribed his paintings in a highly cursive script. The inscription reads: 生涯不貧、大福無隣、 指月看月、途中老賓Shōgai hin narazu daifuku rin nashi tsuki o sashi tsuki o miru tochū no rōhin Throughout my life, I haven’t been poor Nor have lived amid wealth.

653246.jpg	Amusements at Higashiyama in Kyoto	Kano School		ca. 1620s	People from every social class can be seen in vignettes on this screen and its pair—samurai are the central protagonists, with courtiers and court ladies, itinerant performers, and mendicant monks also present. All these citizens of Kyoto take advantage of a sunny afternoon at the peak of the cherry-blossom season in the scenic Eastern Hills, or Higashiyama district. Each screen highlights a famous sacred site—the right shows Kiyomizudera Temple and the left Yasaka Shrine. Both feature a festive outdoor banquet attended by elite samurai. The intricately patterned gold clouds create a dramatic background for colorful genre scenes and inviting landscapes. Masterpieces of Kano school painting, the screens survive in remarkably fine condition and, though relatively small, convey the celebratory spirit of a country finally at peace after nearly a century of civil war.	狩野派 東山遊楽図屏風 Title: Amusements at Higashiyama in Kyoto Artist: Kano School Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1620s Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold, mica, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each screen): 33 1/16 in. × 8 ft. 11 1/2 in.

77184.jpg	Egrets and Cotton Roses	Tosa Mitsuoki	Japanese	mid- to late 17th century	Artists of the Tosa school are known for refined and colorful yamato-e paintings depicting quintessentially Japanese themes such as scenes from The Tale of Genji and other literary classics. Tosa Mitsuoki is, however, also renowned for his works showing quails with flowers or grasses, reflecting an indebtedness to Chinese painting of the Southern Song dynasty. A bird-and-flower painting by Mitsuoki that does not depict quails, such as this rendering of two egrets with cotton roses, is therefore quite rare.This hanging scroll shows the artist painting in a different, somewhat looser style, observable in the flowers, leaves, rocks, and egrets. The birds are painted in the “boneless” method, with minimal outlines, showing the influence of contemporaneous Rinpa artists. The painting demonstrates Mitsuoki’s subtle but definite interest in incorporating stylistic features of the Kano school, especially in the way he executed the rocks with bolder brushstrokes in ink.	土佐光起筆 芙蓉白鷺図 Title: Egrets and Cotton Roses Artist: Tosa Mitsuoki (Japanese, 1617–1691) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid- to late 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 46 5/8 × 22 3/16 in.

663886.jpg	Portrait of Yinyuan Longqi	Painting by an unidentified artist		1676	This portrait depicts Yinyuan Longqi, the Chinese Chan master who, in 1661, founded the Manpukuji Temple outside Kyoto. Likenesses such as this one would have been displayed and venerated during Buddhist ceremonies and memorial services. The eulogistic inscription is by Yinyuan’s direct disciple Mu’an Xingtao, whose celebrated calligraphy recalls both the religious and the brush-writing mentorship of his master. It reads:Firmly grasping a staff, he directly points out that a person has no perceptible form. Nor does a name reflect one’s true identity, which is imperceptible. This truly benevolent person naturally reveals his inherent moral virtue. Upon a sudden understanding of monastic teachings, we can start to perceive things beyond the workaday world. —Adapted from Jonathan Chaves	木庵性瑫賛 隠元隆琦像 Title: Portrait of Yinyuan Longqi Artist: Painting by an unidentified artist , active late 17th century Artist: Inscription by Muan Xingtao (Chinese, 1611–1684) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1676 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 47 in. × 22 3/4 in.

54782.jpg	Lotus Sutra, Chapters 12 and 14		Japan	ca. 1667	The Lotus Sutra, the most popular of all Buddhist scriptures, promises salvation to all who place faith in it. The set to which this handscroll belongs demonstrates how the courtly tradition of late Heian-period sutra copying was revived by the palace in early modern times. Each frontispiece has a delicate miniature painting executed in ink and gold. Margins above and below the text are decorated with designs stenciled in gold, silver, and various colors. The twelfth chapter, “Devadatta” (Japanese: Daibadatta), refers to the name of a friend and mentor of the Buddha in a former life. The frontispiece illustration includes a scene of the daughter of the Dragon King, who lives in a palace in the sea, appearing before the Buddha and presenting him with a precious jewel. The frontispiece of chapter fourteen, though illustrating the section of the sutra called “Peaceful Practices,” shows a fighting scene in the upper-right corner, reminding viewers that the proselytizing efforts of Buddhist monks were often militant.	「提婆達多品」 「安楽行品」 『(法華経)』 Title: Lotus Sutra, Chapters 12 and 14 Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1667 Culture: Japan Medium: Two handscrolls; gold, silver on indigo-dyed paper Dimensions: a: 11 in. × 14 ft. 10 15/16 in.

670915.jpg	Portraits and Poems of the Thirty-six Poetic Immortals	Sumiyoshi Gukei	Japanese	1674–92	This album contains the imaginary portraits of thirty-six of revered masters of poetry from the Nara (710–794) and Heian (794–1185) periods, each accompanied by one of his or her verses on the facing page. Selections of the greatest poets were made by connoisseurs of the late Heian period, with Kakinomoto no Hitomaro (active 686–705), long regarded as the pre-eminent poet of Japan, given first place. The Sumiyoshi school of painting was founded by Jokei (1599–1670), a former member of the Tosa school who established his own atelier in Edo. It specialized in depictions of the “poetic immortals,” and used fine detail and elements drawn from yamato-e—native “Japanese style” painting. Jokei’s son Gukei (also known as Hirozumi) served the Tokugawa shogunate as a painter of both classical subjects and genre scenes.	住吉具慶筆 三十六歌仙画帖 Title: Portraits and Poems of the Thirty-six Poetic Immortals Artist: Sumiyoshi Gukei (Japanese, 1631–1705) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1674–92 Culture: Japan Medium: Album of thirty-six paintings and thirty-six poems; ink, color and gold on silk and paper Dimensions: Image (each leaf): 6 7/8 × 6 5/16 in.

670941.jpg	Fujiwara no Teika’s “Poems on Flowers and Birds of the Twelve Months”		Japan	18th century	One of the greatest literary arbiters of the classical to early medieval era, Fujiwara no Teika (also known as Sadaie, 1162–1241) was a critic, calligrapher, and diarist as well as an author of waka (31-syllable verse) poetry. He was appointed to the Kyoto court’s Bureau of Poetry in 1201, and enjoyed the patronage of Retired Emperor Gotoba (1180–1239). A prolific author, he produced numerous poems and literary commentaries, and was the primary compiler of the eighth imperially-commissioned anthology of poetry, “New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry” (Shinkokin wakashū, circa 1205). His literary achievements exerted a strong influence on Japanese poetry even into modern times.This handscroll contains waka by Teika dedicated to flowers and birds of the twelve months of the year. Each waka accompanies a delicate image replete with poetic and seasonal references, painted in a style derived from the traditional yamato-e (Japanese-style painting) mode of narrative illustration.	定家詠十二ヶ月花鳥図 Title: Fujiwara no Teika’s “Poems on Flowers and Birds of the Twelve Months” Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 7 3/16 in. × 18 ft. 7 1/4 in.

Although slightly less delicate and gossamer in quality than the album paintings of either, the scenes created by this unknown artist exhibit a similar attention to minute detail, highlighted in these albums by layers of mineral pigments and the application of gold and sprinkled gold. Each of the tale’s fifty-four chapters is represented by an illustration. Although devoid of titles or other inscriptions, standardized compositions allow the viewer to identify the chapters, characters, and events depicted.	土佐派 『源氏物語』画帖 Title: Scenes from The Tale of Genji Artist: Tosa School Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of albums (accordion fold) with 54 illustrations; ink, color and gold on paper Dimensions: Album: 8 9/16 × 7 7/8 × 2 1/2 in.

670970.jpg	“A Branch of Sacred Evergreen” (Sakaki), from the Phantom Genji Scrolls (Maboroshi no Genji monogatari emaki)		Japan	mid-17th century	Now dispersed across multiple collections, Chapter 10 originally consisted of six scrolls with approximately thirty paintings. This meticulously detailed section captures the tonsure (cutting off one’s hair to become a monk or nun) of Genji’s stepmother, Fujitsubo, after an elaborate multiday ceremony of Eight Lectures on the Lotus Sutra commemorating the one-year anniversary of the Kiritsubo Emperor’s death.	幻の源氏物語絵巻 「榊」 Title: “A Branch of Sacred Evergreen” (Sakaki), from the Phantom Genji Scrolls (Maboroshi no Genji monogatari emaki) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll section mounted on board; ink, color and gold on paper Dimensions: Image (a): 14 × 54 5/16 in.

671027.jpg	Fifty-Four Scenes from The Tale of Genji		Japan	late 17th century	The eleventh-century literary masterpiece The Tale of Genji is set almost entirely in the capital city of Kyoto and its environs. Here, scenes from all fifty-four chapters appear in sequence across two screens—from right to left and top to bottom—in a composition that transcends shifts in time, season, and setting. The convention of “blown-off roofs” (fukinuki yatai) permits views into interiors, most of them aristocratic mansions. Famous sites such as the iconic bridge over the Uji River (at top left of the left-hand screen), south of Kyoto, are easily recognizable. Viewers familiar with the narrative can enjoy the challenge of identifying characters, episodes, and plot points. The screens were evidently created by a Kano-school painter and at least one assistant; miniature screens seen within the interiors, mostly ink landscapes, betray a hand from around the time of Kano Yasunobu (1613–1685).	源氏物語図屏風 Title: Fifty-Four Scenes from The Tale of Genji Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Each: 66 15/16 in. × 12 ft. 5 3/16 in.

76463.jpg	The Tale of Genji	Attributed to Kaihō Yūsetsu	Japanese	17th century	These handscrolls, representing all fifty-four chapters from Murasaki Shikibu’s literary masterpiece, have been attributed to Yūsetsu, son of ink-painting master Kaihō Yūshō (1535–1615), and twenty-seven calligraphers. The painted scenes, with their skillful brushwork, occasional touches of gold and silver, and distinctive landscape elements, exhibit some similarities to other works associated with Yūsetsu. One scene, for Chapter Forty-five, was executed by a different, less skilled artist, perhaps an apprentice.Although descended from a samurai family, Yūsetsu, who lost his father while young, is known to have operated a shop selling ready-made pictures. His fortunes improved following his introduction to third Tokugawa shogun Iemitsu (1605–1651), and artists of the Kano school; this led to commissions from courtiers and the shogun himself.

671015.jpg	The Third Princess with her Cat, from the "New Herbs I" (Wakana I) chapter The Tale of Genji (Genji monogatari}	Tsukioka Settei	Japanese	18th century	The focal point of one of the tragic romances in the second half of The Tale of Genji is the childlike Third Princess, whom Genji takes to wife in his middle years. While pursuing her runaway cat, the young girl emerges from her living quarters and is seen by Kashiwagi, son of Genji’s best friend, who falls in love with her. This results in a clandestine relationship, Kashiwagi’s guilt-inspired illness and death, and an infant passed off—with Genji’s unspoken knowledge of the truth—as Genji’s offspring.Settei, born in Omi Province, lived and worked in Osaka as an ukiyo-e painter and print artist, designing numerous printed books and producing paintings of beautiful women dressed in the height of contemporary fashion. Many of these were geisha and courtesans, although his late works also included courtly subject matter.	月岡雪鼎筆 女三宮「若菜上」『源氏物語』 Title: The Third Princess with her Cat, from the "New Herbs I" (Wakana I) chapter The Tale of Genji (Genji monogatari} Artist: Tsukioka Settei (Japanese, 1710–1786) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 34 13/16 × 12 7/16 in.

671032.jpg	"Evening Faces" chapter from The Tale of Genji (Genji monogatari)	Kawamata Tsunemasa	Japanese	18th century	In Chapter Four of the narrative Prince Genji visits his old nurse. A young woman in the house next door sends her servant to Genji’s attendant, with the gift of a fan on which a yūgao (“evening faces”) flower has been placed. Genji and the lady embark upon a love affair that ends with her death, when she is possessed by the spirit of the jealous Lady Rokujō, another of Genji’s lovers.This painting bears the signature and seal of Tsunemasa, a painter of ukiyo-e who specialized in pictures of beauties and also themes derived from literature. In his rendition of the “Yūgao” scene, he has dressed his figures in Edo-period garb rather than the multilayered robes of the Heian-period aristocracy. The tall beauty with the tortoiseshell hair comb may represent Yūgao rather than her attendant, and the smaller woman stands in for Genji’s manservant.	川又常正筆 「夕顔」『源氏物語』 Title: "Evening Faces" chapter from The Tale of Genji (Genji monogatari) Artist: Kawamata Tsunemasa (active 1716–48) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 13 1/8 × 21 9/16 in.

671053.jpg	Princess Ogimi from the "Bridge Maiden" (Hashihime) chapter from The Tale of Genji (Genji Monogatari)	Hishikawa Waō	Japanese	early 18th century	In this scene from the forty-fifth chapter of The Tale of Genji, Kaoru—officially known as Genji’s son, although he is the product of an illicit affair between Genji’s wife and a young nobleman—pays a visit to the household of a prince in Uji. There he falls in love with the prince’s daughter Ōigimi. The young girl has been playing her biwa (a lutelike instrument), and she raises the plectrum in the air as if to summon the moon, which appears from behind a cloud.The Edo-based artist Waō specialized in ukiyo-e paintings of beautiful women as well as woodblock prints. Few facts about his life are available, and he is believed by some to have been the same person as the far better-known artist and poet Hanabusa Itchō (1652–1724).	菱川和翁筆 大君 「橋姫」『源氏物語』 Title: Princess Ogimi from the "Bridge Maiden" (Hashihime) chapter from The Tale of Genji (Genji Monogatari) Artist: Hishikawa Waō (Japanese, active early 18th century) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 14 5/8 × 17 15/16 in.

53238.jpg	Zheng Huangniu and Yushanzhu	Painting by Kano Naizen	Japanese	early 17th century	These two legendary Chinese monks of the Chan (Zen) tradition were often paired in Japanese painting beginning in the early Muromachi period (1392–1573). Shown at right is Zheng Huangniu (Japanese: Seiōgyū), whose name means “Zheng of the Yellow Ox.” He was known for riding such an animal, to which he would attach various objects, including jugs and books. As was common in seventeenth-century and later Japanese examples, here Zheng rides his ox backward. His counterpart is Yushanzhu (Japanese: Ikuzanshu), or “Master of Mount Yu.” Yushanzhu is said to have gained enlightenment after falling from his donkey on a bridge. The poetic inscriptions, rendered in a crisp and brusquely brushed style, are by Takuan Sōhō, one of the most influential Zen monks of his day.	狩野内膳筆 沢庵宗彭賛 政黄牛・郁山主図 Title: Zheng Huangniu and Yushanzhu Artist: Painting by Kano Naizen (Japanese, 1570–1616) Artist: Inscribed by Takuan Sōhō (1573–1645) Period: Momoyama period (1573–1615) Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink on paper Dimensions: Image (a): 44 in. × 18 11/16 in.

671040.jpg	Bodhidharma	Unkoku Tōgan	Japanese	early 17th century	This imagined portrait depicts Bodhidharma, the monk credited with transmitting Zen Buddhism from India to China in the sixth century. The image is inscribed with a poem in Chinese by Gyokuho Jōsō (1546–1613), the 130th abbot of Daitokuji, a major Zen monastery in Kyoto. To accommodate the figure, who faces left, the text is read from left to right; this is atypical for Japanese and Chinese writing but common in devotional paintings, where the direction of the text often responds to the orientation of the figure. The poem celebrates Bodhidharma’s early efforts to spread Zen in China: Speeding past Liang and Wei, He cut his trip short. And why did he do so? He held back, for the sake of the unenlightened. —Translated by Aaron Rio	雲谷等顔筆 玉甫紹琮賛 達磨図 Title: Bodhidharma Artist: Unkoku Tōgan (Japanese, 1547–1618) Artist: Inscribed by Gyokuho Jōsō (Japanese, 1546–1613) Period: Momoyama period (1573–1615) Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 35 1/4 × 13 1/8 in.

671028.jpg	Jinshan Island and West Lake	Kano Sanraku	Japanese	1630	Though united visually by an ink landscape of rugged mountains and islands among expanses of water and mists rendered in gold wash, this pair of screens depicts two wholly separate scenic locales in eastern China. At right is Jinshan, an island located in the middle of the Yangzi River near the town of Zhenjiang in southern Jiangsu province. The island’s many bridges, walkways, and paths are traversed by people from all walks of life—scholars, fisherman, and servants, among others—perhaps on their way to one of the temple halls scattered across the rugged terrain. The left screen meanwhile is a portrayal of West Lake, a storied site 150 miles south in the city of Hangzhou, whose city walls and gate can be seen in the lower-left foreground. Sanraku also incorporates into the landscape several of the Ten Views of West Lake, a set of poetic themes that first came into vogue in China during the twelfth century. A student and adopted son of Momoyama-period master Kano Eitoku (1543–1590), Sanraku produced paintings for interiors of castles and temples, including other works depicting West Lake. Here rock formations display the crystalline, geometric quality that appears in much of his late work.	狩野山楽筆 金山西湖図屏風 Title: Jinshan Island and West Lake Artist: Kano Sanraku (Japanese, 1559–1635) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1630 Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, and gold on paper Dimensions: Image: 60 1/16 in. × 11 ft. 9 in.

53009.jpg	Landscapes of the Four Seasons	Kano Tan'yū	Japanese	1630s	At far right, a stream fed by melting snow comes tumbling down out of the mountains, symbolizing the onset of spring. This foreground of waterfalls, bent trees, and rooftops suddenly gives way to an expanse of blank paper—a diagonal swath of mist that parts to reveal distant summer mountains. A flock of geese and the large moon are the only indications of autumn in the left screen (not exhibited), which is dominated by icy mountains and a snow-covered village. A grandson of the great Momoyama painter Kano Eitoku (1543–1590), Kano Tan’yū had, by the time he was a teenager, already become official painter to the second Tokugawa shogun Hidetada (1579– 1632; reigned 1605–1623). This pair of screens is dated on stylistic grounds to the 1630s, when Tan’yū was head of the Kano school’s Kajibashi atelier in Edo, which Tan’yū himself had established in 1621.	四季山水図屏風 Title: Landscapes of the Four Seasons Artist: Kano Tan'yū (Japanese, 1602–1674) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1630s Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 60 3/8 in. × 11 ft. 6 7/8 in.

53010.jpg	Jizō Bosatsu Playing a Flute	Kano Tan'yū	Japanese	mid- 17th century	This elegant vision of the bodhisattva Jizō Bosatsu (Sanskrit: Ksitigarbha) playing a flute is a rare and innovative portrayal that may have been created by Kano Tan’yū himself, who, as head of the Shogun’s painting academy (edokoro), was familiar with most of the ancient paintings that had survived to his day. The few similar paintings known of a flute-playing Jizō are by Tan’yū or his followers. The gentle, boyish figure, dancing, playing a flute, and wearing both the traditional monk’s robe and the flowing scarves and jewels of a bodhisattva, combines several aspects of Jizō’s traditional iconography. Instead of lotus petals, he wears a huge, overturned lotus leaf upon his head. His monk’s staff and sacred wish-granting jewel have been replaced by a phoenix-headed flute.	狩野探幽筆 笛吹地蔵図 Title: Jizō Bosatsu Playing a Flute Artist: Kano Tan'yū (Japanese, 1602–1674) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid- 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 38 3/4 in. × 15 in.

In this episode, a courtier traveling on Mount Utsu (literally, “mountain of sadness”) meets an itinerant monk on his way to Kyoto and asks him to give his regards to a lover in the distant capital.Suruga naru Utsu no yamabe no utsutsu ni mo yume ni mo hito ni awanu narikeri Amid the “sad hills”of Mount Utsuin Suruga Province,I cannot meet my lover,not even in my dreams.—Trans.

77799.jpg	Scene from the Tales of Ise: “Mount Utsu”	Fukae Roshū	Japanese	early 18th century	This scene is inspired by the “Mount Utsu” (literally, “Mountain of Sadness”) episode of The Ise Stories (Ise monogatari), a tenth-century narrative recounting the travels and travails of an unnamed protagonist, whose fictional persona is based on the courtier-poet Ariwara no Narihira (825–880). Rinpa artists often reduced the entire scene, also popularly known as the “Ivy Path” (Tsuta no hosomichi) episode, to an image of an ivy-covered mountain path. The scene shows the courtier and his attendant traveling in the foothills of Mount Utsu. In accordance with the story, on a path overgrown with ivy and maple trees, the pair comes upon a religious ascetic, whom the courtier asks to transmit a poem back to his former lover in the capital. In the poem, the courtier bemoans the fact that he can no longer see his love, not even in his dreams, in which, according to ancient beliefs, lovers are able to meet. Fukae Roshǔ was active in the early eighteenth century, but his small surviving corpus shows that he worked in an archaic Sŏtatsu mode.

53013.jpg	"Kogō" and "The Imperial Procession to Ōhara", from The Tale of the Heike (Heike monogatari)		Japan	early 17th century	These screens depict two iconic scenes from The Tale of the Heike, a fourteenth-century account of late twelfth-century clashes between the rival Taira and Minamoto clans. The right screen represents the story’s “Kogō” chapter, which centers on Lady Kogō, a renowned beauty and accomplished koto player who finds herself banished after being caught in a love triangle involving Emperor Takakura and the leader of the Taira clan. Here, Minamoto no Nakakuni—the repeated figure wearing a red robe—searches for Lady Kogō on a moonlit night at the behest of the emperor. Following the sound of her koto, a type of zither, he tracks her to a dwelling in the Saga Plain of western Kyoto, pictured at far right. The left screen depicts the elaborate procession of Emperor Go-Shirakawa to Ōhara, in the hills north of Kyoto, in order to visit the former empress Kenreimon’in. Now living in a convent, Kenreimon’in is shown in the third panel from the left, seated on a veranda wearing a white robe.	平家物語図屏風 「小督」 「大原御幸」 Title: "Kogō" and "The Imperial Procession to Ōhara", from The Tale of the Heike (Heike monogatari) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 60 7/8 in. × 11 ft. 9 7/8 in.

76462.jpg	Scenes from the Tales of Ise		Japan	first half of the 17th century	Most versions of the tenth-century Tales of Ise comprise 125 uta monogatari, or short tales accompanied by poems. In this pair of early seventeenth-century screens, eight poems have been selected from the tale and inscribed within the gold of the clouds and ground. Each poemtale begins with a brief prose passage that sets up an exchange of waka (poems of 31 syllables) between the aristocratic hero Ariwara no Narihira (825–880) and, for the most part, the numerous women with whom he is romantically involved. (Not all his interlocutors are love interests; his friends and other female characters figure in the tales as well.) The poems reflect upon the famous places and beguiling scenery that Narihira encounters during his travels, thus appealing to the tastes of the cultivated elite. The Tales of Ise has remained influential, serving as a source for illustrations in various media.

75747.jpg	“Takebun,” from the Musical Drama “The New Piece” (Shinkyoku)		Japan	early 17th century	These screens depict the “Takebun” episode of The New Piece (Shinkyoku), an example of the kōwakamai type of musical drama popular in the 1500s. Originally derived from the historical epic Taiheiki and later adapted into a Noh play, the tragic episode centers on the hero Takebun, the bravest and most loyal retainer of an imperial prince. In the right screen, Takebun, the repeated figure wearing a green robe, attempts to rescue the prince’s wife, who has been kidnapped by a samurai. Unable to save her, Takebun dies by ritual suicide, a scene depicted in the fifth panel from the right. The left screen represents the events after Takebun’s death, when he transforms into a vengeful spirit that takes the shape of crashing waves to thwart the samurai’s progress.	新曲図屏風 Title: “Takebun,” from the Musical Drama “The New Piece” (Shinkyoku) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold and silver leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 61 11/16 in. × 11 ft. 11 5/16 in.

53241.jpg	Willows and Bridge		Japan	early 17th century	Paintings that combine willows with a bridge and waterwheel immediately evoke the bridge over the Uji River in southeast Kyoto, a view long celebrated in literary works such as The Tale of Genji. Paintings of the Uji Bridge decorated palaces by the 900s and remained popular for the next thousand years. With their contrast of large, dramatic forms and brilliant metallic shimmer, these screens represent the zenith of the decorative style of the late sixteenth century. Above the golden bridge’s strong diagonal is a copper moon, attached to the screen by small pegs. A large waterwheel turns in the stream and stone-filled baskets protect the embankments. Gently lapping waves of silver pigment have oxidized over time to a dark gray.	柳橋水車図屏風 Title: Willows and Bridge Period: Momoyama period (1573–1615) Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, copper, gold, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 61 5/16 in. × 11 ft. 5/16 in.

53428.jpg	Scenes in and around the Capital		Japan	17th century	The maplike composition of this pair of screens depicts festive scenes and iconic sites in and around Kyoto, among them bustling streets, temples, shrines, and canals set against a panoramic view of the river, surrounding hills, and suburbs. Screens of this type—encyclopedic visualizations that incorporate renowned scenic spots and monuments that served as settings for seasonal events—are also filled with images of townspeople whose customs, garments, mercantile and leisure activities, and modes of transportation are carefully documented. The majority of surviving Kyoto screens, like this pair, separate the city into east and west. On the right screen, the eastern half of the city and the summer Gion festival dominate the street activity, while the left screen shows Nijō Castle and the city’s western half.	洛中洛外図屏風 Title: Scenes in and around the Capital Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 61 7/16 in. × 11 ft. 6 11/16 in.

65417.jpg	Arrival of the Europeans		Japan	first quarter 17th century	This pair of folding screens is characteristic of Nanban byōbu, literally, “Southern Barbarian screens,” showing Europeans landing on Japanese shores. The left screen depicts carracks arriving at a port with sails lowered, while the right screen represents the procession of the ship’s captain and his crew through the main street of the port town and the greeting they receive from a group of missionaries near the entrance to a Christian church. Here, a group of monks—Jesuits (in black) and perhaps Franciscans (in brown)—is assembled inside the church in the main worship hall. Many dark-skinned members of the crew are also included in the depiction. The three women dressed in exotic Chinese robes shown walking ahead of the crew on the right screen, however, are completely imaginary, since no women, European or otherwise, are known to have landed in Japan with the Europeans.	南蛮屏風 Title: Arrival of the Europeans Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: first quarter 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 41 3/8 in. × 8 ft. 6 5/8 in.

53441.jpg	Beauty of the Kanbun Era		Japan	late 17th century	Kanbun bijin, or “Beauty of the Kanbun Era,” is a generic name given to paintings of a woman standing against a neutral background. The tall woman wears her hair in an elaborate style called gosho-mage, or “palace chignon.” The designs on her outer kosode include areas of “fawn-spot” tie-dyeing interspersed with flower patterns, while decorated underlayers are also visible. Around the Kanbun period (1661–73) the width of the obi sash was still quite narrow.	寛文美人図 Title: Beauty of the Kanbun Era Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on paper Dimensions: Image: 24 1/8 × 9 5/8 in.

671018.jpg	Shirabyōshi Dancer and Female Servant; Courtesan and Girl Attendant	Tsukioka Settei	Japanese	mid-18th century	The golden courtier’s cap worn by the women on the right indicates that she is a shirabyōshi, and, as such, she who would have performed an old form of seductive courtly dance in which the women wore male costume. A female attendant helps tie her sash. On the left, a courtesan with an elaborate coiffure, of a style a generation or two before the artist’s time, is accompanied by a girl attendant (kamuro) who carries a satchel and a showy long-stemmed pipe (kiseru), which would have been used when joining a client to smoke tobacco during a visit to the pleasure quarters. The courtesan holds a hozuki (Chinese lantern plant), which ripen during the late summer and, if dried, can be turned into a makeshift whistle. Hozuki were cultivated as a medicinal plant, since ingesting it was said to relieve fevers and ease morning sickness for pregnant women—though it is unclear if the artist wanted to suggest that use here. Tsukioka Settei, who spent most of his life in Osaka, was a prolific illustrator of woodblock-printed books, many of which show manners and customs of women of the historical past, as is the case with this set of paintings. He also became famous as a painter of beauties and erotica.	白拍子・遊女図 Title: Shirabyōshi Dancer and Female Servant; Courtesan and Girl Attendant Artist: Tsukioka Settei (Japanese, 1710–1786) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll paintings, remounted as a two‑panel folding screen; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image (each): 45 in. × 16 1/2 in.

Kaigetsudō Ando was the founder of a studio of artists that produced woodblock prints and paintings of the high-ranking women of the demimonde. Here a poem card (shikishi) is inscribed with a poem attributed to Sarumaru Dayu (active late 8th century) that was made famous through its inclusion in One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets (Hyakunin isshu): Oku yama ni momiji fumi-wake naku shika no koe kiku toki zo aki wa kanashiki Deep in the mountains,traipsing through leaves,a deer cries for its mate—when I hear that sound,it’s autumn at its saddest.—Trans.

53444.jpg	Courtesan Writing a Letter	Kaigetsudō Doshin	Japanese	ca. 1715	Departing from the standard Kaigetsudō-atelier compositional formula of depicting courtesans standing and otherwise unoccupied, here Doshin depicts his subject seated and writing a letter, no doubt to a special client. Courtesans reading or writing letters became a popular subject for ukiyo-e painters of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, and its origins may be traced to more complex genre screens and handscrolls depicting male and female figures within the pleasure district of Kyoto or Edo. The brilliantly colored floral pattern of the woman’s clothes effectively sets off the chalk-white expanses of the letter paper, her delicate hands, and her plump face. The garments are outlined in heavy strokes of dark ink, a feature common to compositions produced in the Kaigetsudō studio. As did all other successors of Kaigetsudō Ando, Doshin signed his name on this work as “Matsuyō” (meaning “last leaf”) of Kaigetsudō.

With the net draped over her uncoiffed hair, she reads a long letter, no doubt from a wealthy patron, and the viewer is left to imagine what kind of news the message contains. Only a few other paintings by Fuhiken Tokikaze are known, but the gentle, corpulent facial features suggest an artist in the circle of Miyagawa Chōshun.	不非軒時風筆 蚊帳美人図 Title: Woman Reading under a Mosquito Net Artist: Fuhiken Tokikaze (active first half of the 18th century) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1720 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 27 1/2 × 14 5/8 in.

670907.jpg	Standing Courtesan	Baiōken Eishun	Japanese	probably 1720s	Baiōken Eishun was among the ukiyo-e artists specializing in paintings of courtesans of the pleasure quarters in the style popularized by artists of the Kaigetsudō studio. He even prefaced his signature with Yamato-e, in the same way Kaigetsudō artists did, to assert that his style of painting was in the distinguished “Japanese-style painting” associated with courtly tastes. Here, a patron or a courtesan has inscribed a poem to add a level of sexual suggestiveness: Though I didn’t sayI was retiring for the nightstill she loosens her sash.She reads my thoughts,bringing tears to my eyes.—Trans.

670931.jpg	The Warrior Asahina Yoshihide Lifting a Puppet of a Courtesan on a Go Board	Torii Kiyoshige	Japanese	mid-18th century	This bizarre but intriguing ukiyo-e painting shows the famous medieval warrior Asahina Yoshihide balancing a puppet of an early Edo-period courtesan on a thick wooden go game board. A young female attendant holds one of Asahina’s hairy legs steady while he performs this muscular act of derring-do. A retainer of the Minamoto clan who fought with family members in a revolt against Hōjō shogunal regents in 1213, Asahina was a historical figure of note. But he is better remembered through literary accounts as the son of the female warrior Tomoe Gozen and through his regular representation in kabuki plays as a warrior of superhuman strength. Asahina’s crest was a crane motif, as seen here, but if the scene is based on theater, the kabuki play that inspired it has yet to be discovered.	伝鳥居清重筆 朝比奈義秀図 Title: The Warrior Asahina Yoshihide Lifting a Puppet of a Courtesan on a Go Board Artist: Torii Kiyoshige (Japanese, active ca. 1716–1759) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color and gold on paper Dimensions: Image: 30 in. × 7 15/16 in.

670926.jpg	Shimabara Courtesans Exorcizing Demons	Miyagawa Isshō	Japanese	second half of the 18th century	Two young, brightly dressed courtesans and an older lady—whose puffed-out cheeks resemble those of the auspicious maiden Otafuku—are performing the ritual act of tossing beans to exorcize evil as part of the Setsubun Festival, celebrated on the eve of the beginning of spring. While tossing beans, people shout, “Out with the demons, in with good luck” (Oni wa soto, fuku wa uchi). Here the artist has literally shown demons fleeing the courtesans and elderly attendant, who stand behind the lattice windows of a brothel. The senryū (seventeen-syllable humorous poem) playfully suggests that for a courtesan of the Shimabara pleasure quarters in Kyoto, the best New Year’s dream would be for a treasure boat to arrive in the form of a wealthy client. There was a custom of placing a picture of a treasure boat under one’s pillow on New Year’s Eve to ensure an auspicious dream. The poem reads: Shimabara noyume ni teki nashitakarabune Nothing rivals the dream of a Shimabara courtesan— brought by a treasure boat. —Kikusai (with handwritten seal)(Trans. John T.

671020.jpg	The Brine Maiden Matsukaze	Nishimura Shigenobu	Japanese	early 18th century	A young maiden leaning against a pine tree by the seashore holds a black courtier’s cap in her left hand. A man’s garment is draped over branch above her. Though the woman’s hair and garments are in the style of the eighteenth century, she represents a character from the Noh play Wind through the Pines (Matsukaze). The play relates the story of two sisters, Matsukaze and Murasame, both brine-gathering maidens at the bay of Suma, who fall in love with Ariwara no Yukihira (818–893), the courtier-poet who has been exiled there. When finally pardoned by the court, Yukihira returns to the capital, leaving his courtier’s cap and robe with the maidens as mementos, along with a promise to send for them in the near future. Yukihira dies shortly after leaving and is unable to fulfill his promise. Distraught at the news of his death, the two sisters drown themselves in the sea. This story of love and despair inspired this parodic version, which replaces the lowly brine maiden with a gorgeously dressed courtesan.	西村重信筆 見立松風図 Title: The Brine Maiden Matsukaze Artist: Nishimura Shigenobu (Japanese, active 1729–39) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 31 9/16 × 11 3/16 in.

She holds two sheets of paper of a variety that can be used for letters, poems, and drawings. In front of her is arrayed a lacquer box with writing implements and a lit candle, indicating a nocturnal setting. The mythical beast called a hakutaku (Chinese: baize), shown in the painting in the alcove signed “Toyonobu,” derives from Chinese legend. Above it is an excerpt from the Japanese encyclopedia Records of the Four Seas (Kairoku) stating that the Yellow Emperor encountered this fantastical beast while on a tour of eastern regions and that it dictated to him accounts of supernatural creatures in the world and how to avoid being haunted or harmed by them. Thus images of the hakutaku were said to ward off disease and harmful influences. The signature “Toyonobu” and the miniature seals in the painting identify the artist as Ishikawa Toyonobu, who became famous for his “lacquer prints” (urushi-e) of kabuki actors and courtesans of the pleasure quarter.	石川豊信筆 文を読む遊女図 Title: Courtesan Reading a Letter Artist: Ishikawa Toyonobu (Japanese, 1711–1785) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 32 7/8 × 8 9/16 in.

53445.jpg	The Auspicious Noh Dance "Okina"	Toriyama Sekien	Japanese	ca. 1790–95	Three dancers perform movements from the ritualized dance called Okina, literally, “Old Man,” or Sanbasō. Performed before the formal program of Noh plays begins, it is a dance without narrative content that is reserved for special occasions such as New Year’s festivities, prayers for prosperity of the nation, and ceremonies to purify the site of a Shinto shrine.On the right is the protagonist Okina, wearing the white mask of an old man and donning an over-robe (kariginu) decorated with a tortoiseshell pattern, a symbol of longevity. The cranes and tortoises that adorn the costumes of the two other dancers are also emblems of longevity. The black mask and the bells held by the dancer on the center scroll identify him as Sanbasō, “the third old man.” On the left is Okina’s young male companion, Senzai, meaning “a thousand years of age.” The artist Toriyama Sekien was trained in the Kano school, but he also created designs for woodblock prints and book illustrations and was the teacher of the celebrated ukiyo-e artist Kitagawa Utamaro (1753–1806).	鳥山石燕筆 「翁」図 Title: The Auspicious Noh Dance "Okina" Artist: Toriyama Sekien (Japanese, 1712–1788) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1790–95 Culture: Japan Medium: Triptych of hanging scrolls; ink, color, and gold on paper Dimensions: Image (a): 34 5/16 × 10 3/4 in.

The obi sash tied in front indicates that she is a courtesan of the pleasure quarters since such knots were easier to unravel than those tied behind, as was the custom for most women. The temporary stands of pine boughs and bamboo stalks were set up along Nakanochō, the main thoroughfare of the Yoshiwara pleasure quarters in Edo (present-day Tokyo). The artist Isoda Koryūsai was born into a warrior-class family but became a masterless samurai (rōnin) after the death of the head of his clan. He moved to Edo where he first made prints on samurai themes but soon shifted to the more salable theme of beautiful women. Occasionally he created deluxe paintings for a wealthier clientele.	磯田湖竜斎筆 花魁と禿の初詣図 Title: Courtesan and Two Attendants on New Year's Day Artist: Isoda Koryūsai (Japanese, 1735–ca. 1790) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1780s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color and gold on paper Dimensions: Image: 33 11/16 × 13 11/16 in.

670909.jpg	Festivities of the Twelve Months: “Sannō Hiyoshi Festivals Held on the Day of the Monkey in the Mid-Fourth Month”; Festivities of the Twelve Months: “Sumō Wrestling at Matsuno’o Shrine during the Hassaku Festival on the First Day of the Eighth Month”		Japan	early 18th century	Hiyoshi (or Hie) Taisha is the head shrine of nearly forty thousand Sannō (“Mountain King”) branch shrines throughout Japan, which are associated with the great templeshrine complex of Enryakuji on Mount Hiei. The festival honoring the guardian, or tutelary, deity Sannō Gongen was held annually at the shrine on or around the day of the monkey (saru no hi) in the middle of the fourth month of the lunar calendar (the beginning of summer). The Hiyoshi (or Hie) Sannō Festival originated during the late eleventh century and is still celebrated today. This scene captures the climax of the festival, which consists of a race of boats carrying portable shrines (mikoshi) of the seven upper shrines across Lake Biwa to Karasaki. The Festival on the First Day of the Eighth Month (Hassakusai), now celebrated in September, has been held since ancient times at Matsuno’o Taisha, or Matsuno’o Shrine, in western Kyoto. Revellers pray for wind and rain in order to ensure a bountiful crop of the “five grains” (rice, wheat, beans, and two kinds of millet). The shrine is said to have been founded in 701 by the Hata clan to enshrine the local deity (kami) of the nearby mountain. Because the Hata family, originally from Korea, introduced a new sake-brewing technique to Japan, the local deity is also worshiped as the deity of brewing, and drinking sake is an essential component of the festivities. As seen in this section of the scroll, amateur sumō wrestling matches were also part of the day’s entertainments.	月波の遊び・「四月中の申の 日山王日吉祭」; 「八月朔日松尾に相撲あり」 Title: Festivities of the Twelve Months: “Sannō Hiyoshi Festivals Held on the Day of the Monkey in the Mid-Fourth Month”; Festivities of the Twelve Months: “Sumō Wrestling at Matsuno’o Shrine during the Hassaku Festival on the First Day of the Eighth Month” Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Two handscrolls; ink, color and gold on paper Dimensions: Image (a): 13 1/8 in. × 37 ft. 11/16 in.

53450.jpg	Window onto Bamboo on a Rainy Day	Gion Nankai	Japanese	first half of the 18th century	Bamboo was a favored theme of Nanga artists, who were largely based in Kyoto and often had backgrounds in Confucian studies and Chinese literati theory. Nankai was the son of a physician and clan official in Wakayama Prefecture. He studied literature and Confucianism in Edo (present-day Tokyo), but belonged to the first generation of influential Nanga painters. His earliest dated painting (1719) was of bamboo, and he produced a number of studies on the same subject.In this depiction, the artist precisely brushed leaves and jointed stalks in varying tones to evoke a rain-soaked atmosphere and dotted ink on the nearby rock for moss. His handling reflects brushwork in woodcut-illustrated Chinese painting manuals, such as the early eighteenth-century Mustard-Seed Garden Manual, that were newly available to Japanese artists. In the Chinese tradition, the strength and flexibility of bamboo are likened to the spirit of the gentleman-scholar who bends but does not break under adversity.	祇園南海筆 「竹窗雨日」図 Title: Window onto Bamboo on a Rainy Day Artist: Gion Nankai (Japanese, 1677–1751) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: first half of the 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 52 5/8 × 22 13/16 in.

Two dense inscriptions in the uppermost register fill the composition’s only open space. The inscription at right includes three poems brushed by Yanagisawa Kien. The inscription at left, however, written five years after his death, includes six poems by the literati painter Miyazaki Kinpo (1717–1774). An early leader of the Nanga movement, Kien taught painting to literati artists Ike Taiga (1723–1776) and Kimura Kenkadō (1736–1802) in their youths.	柳沢淇園筆 山水図 Title: Landscape in the Blue-and-Green Manner Artist: Yanagisawa Kien (Japanese, 1703–1758) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: first half of the 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 53 7/8 × 12 1/2 in.

671023.jpg	Travels through Mountains and Fields	Yosa Buson	Japanese	ca. 1765	Despite the grand scale of a landscape dominated by mountains, lakes, and mist, the eye is drawn to the figures in this pair of folding screens. In the lower right corner of the right screen, an old scholar and his servant make their way toward a small village, where a friend awaits. Leaving the village, they follow a path through rice fields and alongside willows, crossing a bridge leading to the left screen. Although the season has changed, familiar figures appear: a scholar on a path and two others chatting in a thatched hut.Along with Ike Taiga (1723–1776), Yosa Buson is one of the most celebrated Nanga artists. He was a renowned poet—especially of haiku—and a prolific painter. Essentially self-taught, he studied Chinese painting manuals and works of Chinese painters of the past, and developed his own style based on lyrical abstraction and the application of atmospheric ink and light color washes.	与謝蕪村筆 山野行旅図屏風 Title: Travels through Mountains and Fields Artist: Yosa Buson (Japanese, 1716–1783) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1765 Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image (each): 62 1/2 in. × 11 ft. 9 3/4 in.

A cluster of smaller houses is seen in the distance at the right. The gray palette of the painting is highlighted by coal-black ink lines that delineate bare twigs of trees and rounded contours of hills and mountains. Ike Taiga’s inscription at the top right reads “After the brush of Guo Zhongshu, Ike Mumei” (Hō Kaku Chūjo hitsu Ike Mumei). Guo Zhongshu, a tenth-century Chinese painter, was known for his eccentric behavior. Taiga must have become acquainted with Guo’s name and work through painting manuals such as the Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting, introduced in Japan after its first publication in China in 1679.	池大雅筆 倣郭忠恕風雪景山水図 Title: Wintry Landscape, in the Style of Guo Zhongshu Artist: Ike no Taiga (Japanese, 1723–1776) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 39 in. × 12 1/2 in.

The only indications of a shore are tops of spindly reeds bending beneath the wind in the lower right corner and waves cresting close by. On the left screen, willow trees by a river and the moon’s reflection on the surface of the water offer a more quietly lyrical view. In both, the viewpoint is low and pictorial elements are close to the viewer, giving the background space a feeling of great depth. Although they have been handed down as a pair, dates inscribed by Maruyama Ōkyo on each screen are some two decades apart. Ōkyo, founder of the Maruyama-Shijō school, blended Western-style realism with elements from Japanese and Chinese traditions of painting in a manner that made him one of the most popular artists of his day.

670983.jpg	Amusements in Kyoto in the Four Seasons	Maruyama Ōkyo 円山応挙	Japanese	late 1770s–early 1780s	Born to farmers in the Kyoto region, Ōkyo moved to the capital while in his teens and rose from an apprenticeship in a toy shop to being one of the most celebrated artists in Kyoto. The founder of the Maruyama school, he incorporated elements of Chinese painting traditions and Western perspective and realism into Japanese styles. This handscroll is either Ōkyo’s preparatory drawing for, or a sketchlike copy of, his 1777 polychrome handscroll painting of the same title (Tokugawa Art Museum, Nagoya).The scroll begins with a spring cherry- blossom outing on the banks of the Hozu River, followed by townspeople cooling off at the Kamo River in summer; early autumn is represented by traditional Obon dances, and winter by men and women arranging auspicious pine-sapling decorations for the New Year.

These paintings were originally created as four sliding door panels but are now hinged to form a pair of two-panel screens. The painting on the reverse of the panels, which depict seven puppies and bamboo (alluding to an ancient Chinese theme known as the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove), is in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. Following the style of his early teacher Maruyama Ōkyo, especially his naturalistic depiction of animals, birds, and fish, Rosetsu established a reputation as an unrestrained and imaginative painter.	長澤蘆雪筆 雪中狗子図襖 Title: Puppies in the Snow Artist: Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪 (Japanese, 1754–1799) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1792–99 Culture: Japan Medium: Set of four sliding panels mounted as a pair of two-panel screens; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 66 7/16 × 72 1/16 in.

670999.jpg	Drinking Festival of the Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup	Follower of Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪	Japanese	late 18th century	The Tang dynasty poet Du Fu celebrated eight famous drinkers of his age in his poem Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup (Inchū hassenka). In Nagasawa Rosetsu’s playful rendering of this theme, popular with Japanese painters from the late sixteenth century on, the artist has filled his composition with images of the eight drinkers, creating an almost bazaar-like atmosphere. The brushwork in the signature dances a bit compared with his typical style of signing; this could reflect Rosetsu’s harmonizing of his signature with the giddy mood of the painting. Rosetsu was Maruyama Ōkyo’s student and pursued the carefree life of the literati. Hence he was attracted to the unrestrained lives of the individuals shown in this painting.	飲中八仙図 Title: Drinking Festival of the Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup Artist: Follower of Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪 (Japanese, 1754–1799) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 51 5/8 × 23 11/16 in.

671000.jpg	Two Women and a Puppy	Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪	Japanese	1787–88	A lady in a purple kimono with a subtle spiderweb pattern is walking towards the left of the viewer, holding what seems to be a scroll or bundle of papers inside her lavishly decorated brocade obi (sash). Her plump-faced attendant, looking distractedly to the side as if something had caught her sudden attention, is clad in a dark striped kimono with green obi; the bamboo design of the tassels of her apron-like outer garment echoes a similar pattern on the red undergarment of her lady. An adorable puppy observes the two women as they appear to float by. Nagasawa Rosetsu’s idiosyncratic approach to painting beautiful women (bijinga) humorously turns the premise of the genre on its head by showing two ladies as actually not quite so beautiful. The benign, slightly amused expression of the little dog might reflect the sentiment of the artist towards the vanity of the self-absorbed townswomen.	天明美人図 Title: Two Women and a Puppy Artist: Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪 (Japanese, 1754–1799) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1787–88 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 39 3/4 × 13 15/16 in.

Itō Jakuchū, who painted this extraordinary, dreamlike image, was counted as one of the Three Eccentrics of the Edo period, together with Soga Shōhaku (1730– 1781) and Nagasawa Rosetsu (1754–1799). In his exuberant depictions of plant life, he combined seemingly incompatible elements, such as realism with brilliant color and decorative abstraction. Born the eldest son of a wholesale grocer in Kyoto, Jakuchū inherited the family business and ran it for more than fifteen years. It was not until he reached his late thirties that he began to paint full-time. This painting, inscribed with the year 1755, is one of the earliest of his dated works.	伊藤若冲筆 月下白梅図 Title: White Plum Blossoms and Moon Artist: Itō Jakuchū (Japanese, 1716–1800) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1755 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 55 3/8 × 31 1/4 in.

670929.jpg	Hanshan and Shide (Japanese: Kanzan and Jittoku)	Itō Jakuchū	Japanese	late 18th century	Hanshan and Shide (active late 8th–early 9th century) were Chan Buddhist monks who held low-level positions at Guoqingsi, a temple on China’s sacred Mount Tiantai. Turned away from the viewer here, Hanshan (“Cold Mountain”) was a reclusive monk-poet. Shide, his constant companion, carries a broom indicating his role as the temple’s janitor. The pair of figures came to represent an iconoclastic aspect of Chan (Japanese: Zen) monastic practice and was a popular theme in Japanese painting. In the Buddhist tradition, Hanshan and Shide were also honored as emanations of the bodhisattvas Monju and Fugen (Sanskrit: Manjushri and Samantabhadra), representing the virtues of wisdom and compassion. The inscription refers to this association: “One is the Bodhisattva of the Great Path. The other the Patriarch of the Great Buddha. What evidence is there? A broken broom, a tattered scripture, and unrhymed verse” (trans. Aaron Rio).	伊藤若冲筆 伝池大雅賛 寒山拾得 「 一箇大行薩埵、 一箇大佛袒師、 何以為驗 弊帚、殘經落韻詩」 Title: Hanshan and Shide (Japanese: Kanzan and Jittoku) Artist: Itō Jakuchū (Japanese, 1716–1800) Artist: Calligraphy attributed to Ike no Taiga (Japanese, 1723–1776) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 39 1/2 × 11 15/16 in.

At once an artistic tour de force and a demonstration of remarkable religious piety, it was created by Katō Nobukiyo, a minor government official who took Buddhist vows in his early fifties. In 1788 he began creating a set of fifty-one painted scrolls. On all but one he painted ten rakan (enlightened followers of the Buddha); an image of the Buddha with attendant bodhisattvas appears on the fifty-first. In 1792 he dedicated the complete set (including this work) to Ryūkōji, temple in Edo (present-day Tokyo).	加藤信清筆 羅漢図 Title: Ten Rakan Examining a Painting of White-Robed Kannon Artist: Katō Nobukiyo (Japanese, 1734–1810) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1788–92 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 55 1/4 × 22 3/4 in.

671056.jpg	Zhou Maoshu Admiring Lotuses	Kaihō Yūsetsu	Japanese	mid-17th century	A bearded scholar props his elbows on the side of his boat and rests his chin in his hands, leaning over to catch a glimpse of lotuses scattered across the surface of a pond. He is recognizable as the Northern Song-dynasty philosopher Zhou Maoshu (Chinese: Zhou Dunyi, 1017–1073). A leading figure in early neo-Confucian thought, Zhou wrote, among other texts, the short essay “On the Love of the Lotus” (“Ai lian shuo”), in which he describes the lotus as a “man of virtue,” in contrast to the “hermitlike” chrysanthemum and the “aristocratic” peony. After the death of his father, Kaihō Yūshō (1533–1615), Yūsetsu operated a shop selling readymade pictures under the name “Chūzaemon.” Later, he received patronage of Tokugawa Iemitsu, the third shogun, and reverted to using the family name Kaihō.	海北友雪筆 周茂叔愛蓮図 Title: Zhou Maoshu Admiring Lotuses Artist: Kaihō Yūsetsu (Japanese, 1598–1677) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on silk Dimensions: Image: 12 3/4 × 19 5/8 in.

His bald head, scrawny limbs, and bare feet are delineated with smooth brush lines in light ink, while dark spots mark his eyes and the corners of his downturned mouth. The painting was cut down from a larger work, which may have held clues to the identity of the seated figure. The companion piece, on the left panel, depicts a hawk perched on the branch of an oak tree. Soga Nichokuan, well known as a painter of hawks, most likely worked in the vicinity of the port city of Sakai, south of Osaka.	曽我二直庵筆 高士・柏鷹図 Title: Daoist Sage and Hawk Artist: Soga Nichokuan (Japanese, active mid-17th century) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of fan-shaped paintings mounted on two-panel folding screen; ink on paper Dimensions: 73 1/2 x 67 3/4 in.

78145.jpg	Portrait of Bodhidharma	Hakuin Ekaku 白隠慧鶴	Japanese	mid-18th century	An influential monk and prolific painter, Hakuin Ekaku made striking and sometimes humorous pictures that played an important role in his teaching. Dozens of half-length portraits of Bodhidharma (Japanese: Daruma), the Indian monk credited with transmitting Zen Buddhist teachings to China in the sixth century, can be dated to the last few decades of the artist’s life. He brushed a variety of different messages on these pictures, the most common being four Chinese characters conveying a clear lesson: “Look inside yourself to become a buddha.” The inscription on this work communicates the same essential message but is more open-ended: “No matter how you see...” (どふ見ても). With this and a similar message found on other images of Bodhidharma--"No matter when you see..." (いつ見ても)--Hakuin encourages Zen adherents to awaken to the true nature of things, to perceive one's inherent buddhahood, no matter what it takes.	白隠慧鶴筆 達磨像 Title: Portrait of Bodhidharma Artist: Hakuin Ekaku 白隠慧鶴 (Japanese, 1686–1769) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 46 1/4 × 21 1/4 in.

78146.jpg	Tōkaibō with a Fishing Basket	Soga Shōhaku	Japanese	ca. 1768	Dynamically rendered in pale gray ink, a wizened Chinese sagelike figure holds a fishing basket while sitting in a thatched lean-to. His courtier’s cap, gourd jug, and the rocky crag he sits on are highlighted in dark tones. The scene refers to a legendary event in the life of the Chinese nobleman Jiang Ziya (fl. 11th century BC), who is better known as Grand Duke Wang (Taigong Wang), or in Japanese as Taikōbō. One day, legend has it, Emperor Wu Wang while on a hunting trip came across Jiang Ziya fishing and was surprised to learn that the old man did not bait his hook, but waited for the fish to come to him, and was not concerned if he caught no fish at all. Impressed by his strategy of patience, the emperor brought him on as a military advisor, who ultimately helped Kings Wen and Wu of Zhou overthrow the Shang.The presence of the small seal reading “Soga Teruo” helps narrow down the date of execution to around 1768.	曽我蕭白筆 太公望図 Title: Tōkaibō with a Fishing Basket Artist: Soga Shōhaku (Japanese, 1730–1781) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1768 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 52 1/2 in. × 21 in.

78147.jpg	Portrait of Daruma	Fūgai Ekun	Japanese	early 17th century	Daruma (Sanskrit: Bodhidharma) is the first patriarch of Zen Buddhism, who, according to legend, sat in continuous meditation for nine years in a cave in northern China. Following the medieval tradition of monochromatic depictions of Daruma, the Sōtō sect Zen master Fūgai Ekun created numerous minimalist, powerful paintings such as this. The extensive blank space both accommodates an inscription and suggests a metaphysical state of nothingness.	風外慧薫筆 達磨図 Title: Portrait of Daruma Artist: Fūgai Ekun (Japanese, 1568–1654) Period: Momoyama (1573–1615)–Edo (1615–1868) period Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 30 1/2 x 12 1/8 in.

78156.jpg	Portrait of Daruma	Unkoku Tōgan	Japanese	early 17th century	Daruma (the Japanese abbreviated pronunciation of the Sanskrit Bodhidharma) was among the most common subjects for Zen monk-painters. Born in India in the 6th century A.D., Daruma is recognized as the first patriarch of Chan (Japanese: Zen) Buddhism in China. Unkoku Tōgan’s portrait of Daruma is presented in full profile—a somewhat uncommon rendering, though precedents exist in surviving works attributed to Sesshū and his celebrated Chinese predecessor Muqi (active until 1279). Usually the Buddhist saint is presented in three-quarters profile, or in a full-frontal view. Since Daruma came from India, he is inevitably rendered as South Asian, hirsute, and with a bulging nose. Here the outline of his cranium, from the back of the neck to the curve of the nostril, is skillfully rendered in a single modulated stroke—a trademark of many later ink renditions of the monk by other artists. The facial expression is captured with the utmost economy of brush strokes. The elongated earlobes and earring serve as a signal of a connection to the historic Buddha, who was born into a royal family, and thus wore jewelry. The outlines of the robes are rendered in boldly brushed, almost calligraphic lines. The figure of the master is left mostly in reserve except for the grey lines of his shaggy hair and beard, silhouetted against the surrounding in gray wash that creates an amorphous blank space—not darkness, not bright sky—just nothing.Tōgan was an artist trained in the Kano atelier who positioned himself as an heir to the legacy of Chinese ink painting in the style of Tōyō Sesshū (1420–1506). Born into a wealthy samurai family in Nagasaki, Tōgan eventually moved to Yamaguchi to serve as an official painter for the daimyō Mori Terumoto. While based in Yamaguchi, Tōgan was allowed live in the temple building Unkoku’an, “Hermitage in the Valley of Clouds,” once occupied by Sesshū. By taking Buddhist vows himself and immersing himself in the study of Sesshū, Tōgan created numerous Zen-inspired works.

78134.jpg	Autumn Flowers in a Bamboo Basket	Yosa Buson	Japanese	1760s	An informal bouquet of autumn flowers stands in a tall Chinese-style bamboo basket with an elegant rounded handle. Chrysanthemums (kiku), Chinese bellflowers (kikyō), and rose mallows (fuyō) are all associated in traditional Japanese poetry with autumn, their season of full bloom. The Nanga-school artist Yosa Buson styles himself “Chōkō” in his signature, indicating that he painted this in his mid- to late forties. He used a technique for rendering the flowers called sumi-nijimi, or “ink blurring,” in which the artist applies brushstrokes to the surface of ink washes before they have dried, creating an evocative, soft texturing effect. This contrasts with the short horizontal strokes in dark ink used to convey the texture of the plaited bamboo.	与謝蕪村筆秋草花竹籃図 Title: Autumn Flowers in a Bamboo Basket Artist: Yosa Buson (Japanese, 1716–1783) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1760s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 84 1/4 in. × 11 in.

667348.jpg	Courtesan and Attendant Playing with a Dog	Nishikawa Sukenobu	Japanese	ca. 1716–1736	A gorgeously arrayed young courtesan steps out on a verandah while holding a little dog on a red leash. Her teenage attendant tosses a ball to the cheerful dog tied with red rope collar to which a small brass bell is attached. The scene can be interpreted as a parodic representation of the Princess Sannomiya scene from The Tale of Genji where the princess is standing behind a reed curtain and the leash of a cat gets tangled up with the curtain cord and she is unexpectedly seen by courtiers playing kemari (aristocratic kickball) nearby. That scene from the early eleventh century tale becomes the quintessential scene of voyeurism of beautiful women through the ages. Nishikawa Sukenobu replaces the princess with a courtesan of the Kyoto pleasure quarters, the cat with a dog, and the courtiers playing kemari with a young woman with a thread ball. This painting was formerly in the William Sturgis Bigelow Collection, and sold at auction in 1932.

667353.jpg	Horse Racing at Kamo Shrine		Japan	late 17th–early 18th century	Beginning in the ninth century, an annual horse race was held in early spring as part of festival celebrations at the Upper Kamo Shrine in Kyoto. People from all walks of life—courtiers and court ladies, samurai, and commoners—enjoyed the festivities. The race (Kamo kurabeuma) was a great spectacle, and an opportunity for aristocratic riders to demonstrate their riding skills and show their best horses. Many in attendance seem in rapt attention to the main event, while other vignettes depict people engaged in an array of activities. This set of screens was produced probably sometime during or around the Genroku era (1688–1704), a period associated with developments in luxury and fashion trends.	賀茂神社競馬図屏風 Title: Horse Racing at Kamo Shrine Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th–early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each screen): 40 3/4 in. × 8 ft. 7 15/16 in.

78057.jpg	Zen Master with Meditation Staff, and Chinese-Style Landscapes	Painting by Unkoku Tōeki	Japanese	probably late 1620s–1644	Pre-modern Japanese portraiture does not necessarily display accurate likeness, but the figure here, in the chinsō tradition of portraiture of Zen masters, seems individuated; it may be the Zen master Ten’yū Jōkō himself, or his master. He holds an “admonition staff” (shippei) in his hands for alerting sleepy students in meditation. Landscapes were common in Zen ink painting from the late fourteenth century, and it became a convention to create triptychs of work with a natural images flanking an image of a Buddhist deity or eminent monk. Here we find the common motifs of cliffs, rocky outcrops, pavilions, and a lone figure crossing a bridge. The painter Unkoku Tōeki was the son of Tōgan, founder of the Unkoku school which claimed descent from Sesshū, the great master of monochrome ink painting. In the early 1620s, Tōeki worked at the sub-temples of Daitokuji, where Ten’yū was active.Each scroll features a poetic inscription by Ten’yū, who in 1625 became the 169th abbot of the Rinzai Zen temple complex Daitokuji, Kyoto. Ten’yū also went by the name “Muhanshi” 夢伴子, used in the signature here. Ten’yū was a student of Mankō Sōtei—also abbot of Daitokuji. Ten'yū founded Baigan’an at this temple complex and it is thought that he designed the famed south garden. He was a close colleague of the eminent Zen master Takuan Sōhō as attested by his written tribute, as well as an inscription on a statue of Takuan installed at Nanshūji, a branch temple of the complex located in Sakai where Ten’yū was abbot.

78140.jpg	Sparrows in a Plum Tree	Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪	Japanese	second half of the 1790s	A common topic in Japanese bird-and-flower painting, sparrows and blossoming plum branches evoke the beginning of spring, which according to the lunar calendar would begin in early February. Rosetsu fills the composition with a profusion of twigs that abruptly twist and turn. The calculated disorder of the plum branches finds its echo in the numerous sparrows, many of which the artist painted in slight variations of similar poses. Birds or other animals that gaze straight towards the viewer, almost as if they wanted to enter into direct communication with the human observer (such as the pair of sparrows on the lowermost branch), are a visual strategy that Rosetsu employed in many of his paintings, for instance in the diptych of hanging scrolls of cranes, also in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (2011.572.2a, b). The inclusion of a rose bush strikes one as unusual, as this flower is not a subject matter commonly found in early modern Japanese painting.	梅雀図 Title: Sparrows in a Plum Tree Artist: Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪 (Japanese, 1754–1799) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: second half of the 1790s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 44 1/2 x 15 11/16 in.

78153.jpg	Landscape and Couplet of Chinese Verse	Ike no Taiga	Japanese	late 18th century	Ike Taiga juxtaposes a landscape of towering mountains of an almost impossible steepness with a four-line poem by the Tang-dynasty poet Li Bai, celebrating the spirit of solitude found within unspoiled nature. A pathway leads from close to the lower margin into the center of the composition and draws the viewer into the pictorial space. It seems to invite us to imagine ourselves in the place of the lonely wanderer shown in the center of the image. The man is likely meant to be the poet himself, since the walking pole is an iconographic convention for representing Li Bai. The poem reads:The birds have vanished down the sky. Now the last cloud drains away. We sit together, the mountain and me, until only the mountain remains. —Trans.

712056.jpg	Amusements in a Mansion		Japan	mid-17th century	This detailed screen painting dates to a peaceful period when the warrior elite commissioned images of themselves at leisure. Hosts and their escorts enjoy amusements of every variety, including musical performances, eating and drinking, dancing, and strolling in an elaborately landscaped garden with a miniature Mount Fuji. Notably, the wealthy male hosts are joined not only by courtesans and female entertainers (as was common in genre paintings of the period) but also by young male escorts called wakashu. Many elegantly dressed figures wear kosode (the predecessor of the modern kimono) with large, colorful, asymmetrical patterns reflective of contemporary fashions popularized by woodblock-printed pattern books. The motifs on these kosode include flora and fauna as well as elements from everyday life—kemari balls, snow-flakes, and waterwheels.	邸内遊楽図屏風 Title: Amusements in a Mansion Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Each: 38 3/16 in. × 8 ft. 10 11/16 in.

752036.jpg	Activities of the Twelve Months	Sakai Hōitsu	Japanese	late 1790s	This group of eleven scrolls originally belonged to a set of 12 depicting Japanese customs and objects associated with the monthsof the year. Two represent traditional activities: the imperial court ritual of the First Month, known as Shihōhai, in which the Emperor and officials worship the Four Cardinal Directions, and the “Shichi-go-san mairi” celebration in the Eleventh Month for three- and five-year old boys and five- and seven-year old girls. Other paintings depict objects such as the ornamental scented ball, or kusudama, used in festivals of the Fifth Month, and a type of mulberry leaf associated with the Tanabata, or Milky Way, festival in the Seventh Month. The image for the Eighth Month is a classically poetic representation of the autumn season, with foliage—bellflowers, maidenflowers, and knotweed—set against a full moon. The artist, Sakai Hōitsu, was one of the most important painters of the late Edo-period Rinpa school, although early in his career his paintings reflected training in the Kano-school style, as well as Ukiyo-e. The hanging scrolls in this set were executed in a variety of styles, including the Rinpa mode adopted by Hōitsu around the close of the 1790s, when the work of Ogata Kōrin (1658–1716) first began to dominate his artistic development. Typical of Rinpa style and aesthetic, and visible in the compositions for the Sixth and Eighth Months, is the use of tarashikomi: application of ink or color to the already wet surface of paper or silk, creating a pooled or mottled effect. Rinpa paintings also often contain visual allusions to poetry and other works of literature, as in the image for the Sixth Month, referencing Chapter Four (“Yūgao”) of The Tale of Genji (Genji Monogatari). Thus Hōitsu, who was trained in poetry as well as painting, must have found the art of Kōrin and his circle to be doubly appealing.	酒井抱一 「月次絵」 Title: Activities of the Twelve Months Artist: Sakai Hōitsu (Japanese, 1761–1828) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 1790s Culture: Japan Medium: Eleven hanging scrolls from a set of twelve; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image (each): 24 1/2 × 12 7/16 in.

Kabuki as we know it today—a respected form of classical theater with complex plots performed by male actors in men’s and women’s roles—did not emerge until the end of the seventeenth century. This recently rediscovered work is one of a pair; its mate depicts merrymaking in the Kitano district of Kyoto.	狩野孝信工房作 女歌舞伎図屏風 Title: Women’s Kabuki Artist: Studio of Kano Takanobu (Japanese, 1571–1618) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid- to- late 1610s Culture: Japan Medium: Six-panel folding screen; ink, color, gold, silver, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image: 31 1/2 in. × 8 ft. 9 11/16 in.

816200.jpg	White Heron	Tawaraya Sōtatsu	Japanese	early 17th century	The softness and calm seen in this rendering of a solitary white heron amid reeds would become a hallmark of Rinpa ink painting modes used to render animals or Buddhist and Daoist sages, in distinct contrast to the brightly colored compositions on floral or arboreal themes for which Sōtatsu and his successors Ogata Kōrin in the eighteenth century and Sakai Hōitsu in the nineteenth century became famous. The pale and seemingly hazy outlines of this monochrome ink painting may at first appear to have been brushed in a rather casual manner, but closer examination reveals the verve and expert control of the brush the artist had.Sōtatsu had many followers during his time and in subsequent generations who created similar ink paintings, sometimes based on copies that Kōrin made in the eighteenth century, but the sureness of brushwork and the confirmation of the signature and seal in this case (often missing in some works) signals its indisputable authenticity. The work comes from one of the most distinguished collections in Japan (the Manno family collection) and is a true treasure of early seventeenth-century ink painting.	俵屋宗達筆 白鷺図 Title: White Heron Artist: Tawaraya Sōtatsu (Japanese, ca. 1570–ca. 1640) Period: Momoyama (1573–1615)–Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 42 15/16 × 17 11/16 in.

816203.jpg	Festive Dancing at a Samurai Residence (Fūryū odori zu byōbu)	Unidentified artist		ca. 1660	In the garden of a grand samurai residence, guests dance to the music of small hand drums (tsutsumi), a larger shime-daiko drum held by a girl and played by a young man, a bamboo transverse flute (shinobue), and a three-stringed shamisen played by a minstrel, seen from behind. Several of the wakashu, male youths who often served as companions to older samurai patrons, are dressed in garments more appropriate for young women, but can be identified by their shaven pates and swords. The dancers wave their arms and tap sticks in time to the music, performing furyū-odori, fashionable, modern dances popular at festivals in the early to mid-seventeenth century and also enjoyed at private gatherings, as depicted here.The unknown artist was very likely a machi-eshi, or town-based painter with no close affiliation to any particular school of painting. Bright colors and detailed textile patterns such as those seen here were frequently used in genre paintings depicting the various classes of Edo-period society and the celebration of various festivals. Such images are precursors of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”) scenes of the pleasures of urban life that began to flourish in the later years of the 17th century and grew in popularity and sophistication over the next two hundred years.	風流踊図 屏風 Title: Festive Dancing at a Samurai Residence (Fūryū odori zu byōbu) Artist: Unidentified artist Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1660 Culture: Japan Medium: Four-panel folding screen; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 19 13/16 × 70 7/8 in.

816204.jpg	Dancer with a Sword	Unidentified		ca. 1670	The dancer in fantastic costume creates a visual conundrum to anyone familiar with the history of Japanese dress. At first glance we would imagine this must be a male courtier wearing an eboshi (palace headgear) tied with elaborate red silk cords and donning ceremonial swords. Attached to the backside of the sash are ceremonial paper wand traditionally associated with Shinto rituals. Yet viewed in the history of performance, another interpretation unfolds. On one hand, the costume closely resembles that of female shirabyōshi performers of the early medieval times who cross-dressed in courtier robes for entertaining nobility with elegant dances and songs, and also sometimes serving as amorous companions. Yet this painting dates to the late seventeenth century, and captures the appearance of a female performer who performed otokomai, literally “manly dances.” Further visual confusion is caused because the hairstyle since, the upright topknot below the hat is a tonsorial style associated with male teenage performers generically referred to as wakashu, or “youths.” Thus the painting captures a fashionable type of performance of the second half of the seventeenth century of young women wearing anachronistic aristocratic fashion. The frisson of transvestite entertainment, poking fun at authority, and fabulous over-the-top fashion sensibility enjoyed widespread popularity both in private and public stages. An entire subgenre of genre painting, being produced parallel and simultaneously with paintings called Kanbun bijin, “beauties of the Kanbun period.” of the 1670s and 80s, which showed young women donning similarly gorgeous raiment. Such images of individual entertainers, male and female, against a blank background anticipated the genre of ukiyo-e paintings and prints that would emerge along with new forms of popular literature at the end of the seventeenth century.	男舞図 Title: Dancer with a Sword Artist: Unidentified Artist Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1670 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 17 5/16 × 10 13/16 in.

816205.jpg	Poems on “Wind” from Japanese and Chinese and Poems to Sing	Horie Yorinao (Tōgen)	Japanese	1670	This section of a handscroll of Japanese and Chinese Poems to Sing (Wakan rōeishū) was brushed by Horie Tōgen (or Yorinao) a celebrated calligrapher of the late seventeenth century who served as local retainer (hanshi) of the daimyo clan that ruled the Marugame fief of Sanuki province (modern-day Kawagawa prefecture) on Shikoku. Even though raised in a samurai household, Tōgen practiced jōdaiyō, archaic script type harkening back to the peak of Heian-period court culture of the eleventh and twelfth century. He then developing his own distinctive handwriting style, as shown here that combines courtly elegance—without any cloying—and a certain bravado. The underpainting shows highly stylized maiden flowers (ominaeshi). The two poems transcribed here belong a section of the Japanese and Chinese Poems to Sing anthology entitled “Wind” (Kaze 風), and comprises a couplet of seven-syllable Chinese verse, and a single waka (31-syllable court verse). The first poem, in archaic Chinese, was composed by not very well known courtier-scholar Fujiwara no Yukikatsu (Yukifuji, fl. ca. 960): 風 漢主手中吹不駐。徐君墓上扇猶懸。 Kaze Kanshu no te no uchi ni fukite todomarazu Jokun ga tsuka no ue ni ōgi de nao kakareri Wind In the hands of the ruler of Han, it blows without ceasing: Above the grave of Master Xu it fans what hangs there still. At first glance, the verse does not specifically mention “wind” but alludes to Gaozu, the founding emperor of the Han dynasty, was said to have wielded a “three-foot sword,” which he boasted allowed him to conquer all the Chinese empire; the wind here is compared to its sharpness. The second part of the couplet refers to sword left by Li Kong to dangle over the grave of his friend Xu Jun. Though not specifically mentioned, in the first line, the sword is a metaphor for the wind, and in the second line it fans the sword left dangling from the tree. The Chinese verse is accompanied by a waka by courtier-poet Minamoto no Saneakira (910–970), who was later recognized as one of the Thirty-six Poetic Immortals, a roster of great poets of the Japanese literary tradition. The poem included selected here reads: ほの／\と有明の月のつき影に もみぢふきおろす山おろしの風 Honobono to ariake no tsuki no tsukikage ni momiji fuki-orosu yamaoroshi no kaze Dimly, dimly,in the moonlight at the break of dawn, crimson leaves flutter in the wind from the hills.(trans. John T. Carpenter) The box is inscribed by the noted Nihonga painter Yasuda Yukihiko 安田靫彦 (1884–1978) attributing the painting to Ogata Kenzan (1663–1743), which is highly implausible, since the Rinpa artist would have been but eight years old when he did the scroll. The attribution was no doubt the result of the highly stylized manner of painting.	「風」：詩歌巻断簡 Title: Poems on “Wind” from Japanese and Chinese and Poems to Sing Artist: Horie Yorinao (Tōgen) (Japanese, 1606–1693) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1670 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 10 5/8 × 16 3/8 in.

816207.jpg	A Gatha (Contemplative Verse) by Fu Daishi (497–569)	Bankei Yōtaku (Eitaku)	Japanese	late 17th century	Three dynamic columns of flowing cursive Chinese characters spell out the philosophy of the seventeenth-century Rinzai master Bankei Yōtaku, who was renowned for advocating a philosophy—informed by Daoism and Zen Buddhism—of what he called the “Unborn.” The inscription here encapsulates the mystical outlook inherent in his spiritual teachings: 物先天地 無形本寂寥 能 爲萬象主不逐四時凋 Existing even priorto heaven and earth without form, silent,alone by itself,Its boundless powercontrols all creation;It remains unchangedas the seasons unfold.

Carpenter) Fu Daishi, the Buddhist Master Fu or Great Teacher Fu, even though a lay practitioner (not a monk) earned the respect as one the great Chinese Buddhist teachers of his times, and was even said to be an incarnation of the Buddha of the future, Maitreya. Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty, a devout Buddhist, was also a fervent student of his teachings. Fu Daishi also earned acclaim as a philanthropist and, for instance, funded the construction of Shuang-lin-ssu Temple and an attached sutra repository on the premises to house the entire collection of Buddhist scriptures. The repository was distinctive in that it had a revolving stand with eight faces for storing the scriptures, a type of repository that became common in later centuries. Therefore, portraits of him often show him posed near such sutra repositories; he is often also depicted with a laughing face and known in Japan as a Laughing Buddha or warai-botoke.	盤珪永琢書 傅大士の偈 Title: A Gatha (Contemplative Verse) by Fu Daishi (497–569) Artist: Bankei Yōtaku (Eitaku) (Japanese, 1622–1693) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 49 5/8 × 20 3/8 in.

816208.jpg	Record of a haiku exchange on kaishi writing paper	Matsuo Bashō	Japanese	second half of the 17th century	This sheet of kaishi writing paper is inscribed with verse by Japan’s most famous haiku poet, Matsuo Bashō, and one of his pupils in the teacher’s own handwriting. When this work was first publically displayed at Seattle Asian Art Museum in 2015, it created a small sensation among literary specialists in Japan because not only were the Bashō poems recorded here previously unknown, the work must date to relatively early in his career as a poet, before he turned forty. In the West, it would be the equivalent of discovering a manuscript with previously unpublished poems by (Bashō’s contemporary) John Milton in his own hand. At the time of the discovery, the Bashō expert Professor Tamaki Tsukasa stated that the handwriting, seal, and signature could also be authenticated as genuine, keeping in mind that forgeries of Bashō manuscripts abound (for instance, The Met has one in its collection). The document records the exchange of poems with Sugiki Shōei (Fusai, 1628–1706)), a master of wabicha tea ceremony and haikai poet. A record of an exchange of poetic sentiments such as this, interwoven with allusions to Buddhist enlightenment, tea, sake, and a humble dwelling, inscribed by the master Bashō in his distinctive, idiosyncratic handwriting would have been preserved as a tea hanging. The exchange reads as follows:The man of leisure clutches my sleeve— What is it? Haiku. —Shōei My first move toward enlightenment: Answering the rain falling on the plantains. I broke off a Rose of Sharon as a garnish for my sake cup. —Bashō The hut is sparsely furnished, and storms have broken the walls, rain has soaked the tatami mats. Outside the window, the plants do as they please, and the trees do not correct their bends. The householder I admire dwells in a forlorn shack amid the vines of ivy.—BashōI think I will pick some to boil water for tea: stems of bush clover. —Shōei (Translations by Paul Atkins from labels at the Seattle Asian Art Museum, 2015)	松尾芭蕉書 句懐紙 Title: Record of a haiku exchange on kaishi writing paper Artist: Matsuo Bashō (Japanese, 1644–1694) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: second half of the 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 11 5/16 × 18 3/8 in.

The school’s religious and political influence would grow to hold sway even in the imperial palace in Kyoto. The painting is by an imperial princess, daughter of the highly cultured and spiritually inclined Emperor Go-Mizunoo.

816210.jpg	Copy of Night Parade of One Hundred Demons from the Shinjuan Collection	Mochizuki Gyokusen	Japanese	18th century	A parade of demons—comprised of household utensils, tools, and personal accessories like folding fans, coils of incense, and musical instruments come to life— makes its way from right to left in this horizontal composition. The monstrous but humorous-looking creatures appear in all shapes and sizes, some taking on rather grotesque human features while others resemble animals, birds, or demonic creatures from Buddhist hell paintings. Passages of ink wash suggest the nighttime setting. At the conclusion of the handscroll, the demons turn and flee from the fiery light of the rising sun. The image is based on ancient legends about demons and goblins who parade by night through the streets and even the mansions of the old capital city (Kyoto), until the dawn causes them to return to their otherworldly realm. These beliefs combined with folktales claiming that worn out household utensils could be transformed into demons to plague mankind at night. Mochizuki Gyokusen, the Kyoto-based artist of the Cowles handscroll, came from a samurai family and studied with at least two different teachers—one a Tosa-school painter, the other a Kano-affiliated artist. He allegedly created this work as a copy of a sixteenth-century handscroll version of the theme in the collection of the Shinjuan temple of the Daitokuji temple complex in Kyoto.	望月玉蟾筆 真珠庵蔵百鬼夜行絵巻図 Title: Copy of Night Parade of One Hundred Demons from the Shinjuan Collection Artist: Mochizuki Gyokusen (Japanese, 1692–1755) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 12 3/8 in. × 11 ft. 7/8 in.

While serving as a feudal official he practiced a variety of artistic pursuits, excelling particularly in painting and calligraphy.

Drawing on the calligraphy tradition established by his Chinese predecessors, he developed a bold, dynamic, yet flowing style. Here, he inscribed a famous verse by Hanshan, an eccentric monk of eighth-century China, which had become popular among Japanese tea adepts:吾心似秋月 碧潭清皎潔無物堪比倫 教我如何説My heart is like the autumn moon,shining clean and clear in the green pool.Nothing in existence rivals it, instructing me on how to preach.—Adapted from Burton Watson	売茶翁筆 寒山五言絶句「秋月」 Title: Chinese Poem on the Autumn Moon by Hanshan Artist: Baisaō (Japanese, 1675–1763) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1760 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 11 1/4 × 19 11/16 in.

816213.jpg	Samurai and Wakashu (Male Youth)	Miyagawa Isshō	Japanese	early 18th century	Isshō created a rare Ukiyo-e-school painting of a young man and an older man. At left is a gender ambiguous young male Kabuki actor, or wakashu. At right is an older suitor trying to seduce him by grasping his sleeve. The young man's kerchief is a called a yarō bōshi, worn by wakashu actors after shaving their foreheads, a mark of coming of age. Onnagata (adult male Kabuki actors who played female roles) through the Edo period also wore such kerchiefs. The composition parodies the “armor pulling” (kusazuri biki) scene from Soga Brothers vendetta plays in which the older warrior Asahina tugs at the armor of the impetuous young Soga Gorō tugs at the lappers of his brother Asaina’s armor to stop him from going fool heartedly into a confrontation he cannot survive.	宮川一笑筆 武士と若衆 Title: Samurai and Wakashu (Male Youth) Artist: Miyagawa Isshō (Japanese, 1689–1780) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 33 3/8 × 17 5/16 in.

Here the learned man holds a fan painted with a Chinese-style landscape; a closed book lies at his feet. The artist, Maruyama Ōkyo, is renowned today as the founder of the Maruyama school of painting. Although the work is a copy of an earlier painting, Ōkyo’s delineation of the face nonetheless reflects a concern with the realistic portrayal of human figures.

816206.jpg	Chinese Beauty	Yokoi Kinkoku 横井金谷	Japanese	8th month, 1797	Yokoi Kinkoku was a Nanga artist famous for his Chinese-style landscapes, but this relatively early work is a rare example in the artist's corpus of a figural subject in a style not generally associated with the Nanga movement. An elegant Chinese lady in a colorful robe with a green scarf over her shoulders, a jeweled ornament in her hair, sits on a bench upon which various accoutrements for refined living—a rolled scroll, an incense burner, a cup, and a handwarmer—have been placed. This image was painted with delicate precision and detail, and in some respects resembles other paintings of Chinese beauties by several of Kinkoku's contemporaries, most notably Maruyama Ōkyo (1733–1795) and his followers such as Genki (1747–1797). Typical of such images are the very slender figure and narrow, sloping shoulders, the coiffed hair, and aristocratic garb. In some instances, these paintings were meant to depict figures from Chinese history or legend, but in the absence of identifying attributes, it is difficult to say whether this fragile-looking lady was intended as an image of a specific beauty from Chinese antiquity or a more generalized image.Yokoi Kinkoku belonged to the mature phase of the Nanga school movement and was influenced by the work of the great Yosa Buson (1716–1783), although there is no documentary evidence of his having studied directly with him. His paintings are often characterized by rough and dynamic brushwork, almost expressionistic in feeling, so this image presents a striking contrast to his usual style.	唐美人図 (Tō bijin zu) Title: Chinese Beauty Artist: Yokoi Kinkoku 横井金谷 (Japanese, 1761–1832) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 8th month, 1797 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 44 1/16 × 14 1/16 in.

823663.jpg	“Taira no Koremori’s Farewell,” from The Tale of the Heike (Heike monogatari)	Iwasa Matabei (Katsumochi)	Japanese	ca. 1640	This painting pictorializes a scene from The Tale of the Heike, the great early medieval tale of war, valor, and tragic love that commemorates the Genpei War of 1180–85, which pitted the two great courtier families—the Taira (Heike clan) and Minamoto (Genji clan)—against each other. Matabei captures one of the most pivotal and poignant episodes of the entire tale, showing one of the last heirs to the Taira family’s power, Lieutenant General (Chūjō) Koremori, bidding farewell to his wife. As an artist, Matabei established a reputation for adding psychological suggestiveness to his compositions, seen here in the central figures, where the poses and effective use of blank space imply that both realize they will hereafter be separated. In contrast, the attendants have animated facial expressions, manifesting the exaggerated features for which the artist became famous.	岩佐又兵衛筆 『平家物語』 平維盛 北の方惜別図 Title: “Taira no Koremori’s Farewell,” from The Tale of the Heike (Heike monogatari) Artist: Iwasa Matabei (Katsumochi) (Japanese, 1578–1650) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1640 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, gold and silver on paper Dimensions: Image: 23 1/4 × 14 3/4 in.

752008.jpg	Dreaming Cat	Hōzōbō Shinkai	Japanese	mid-17th century	A chubby cat, sensitively rendered in soft brushstrokes of ink in varying tones, is blissfully resting. We see the feline from the front, with its front legs tucked beneath, so that its body forms nearly a perfect circle, with the rear haunches symmetrically protruding from each side. The background is completely blank, with the exception of the three columns of gracefully brushed calligraphy of the artist’s own poem, accompanied by the artist’s signature and anchored by a square red seal. The overall effect is one of serenity, yet at the same time humor and playfulness.The artist’s own witty poem—a kyōka (literally, “madcap verse”)—makes us reinterpret the image:とっくりとねこのねむりのふかみぐさ胡蝶の夢をみるにやあるらむTokkuri to neko no nemuri nofukami-gusakochō no yume omiru ni aruramuDeep asleep the cat lies as if amid “deep grasses” of peony blossoms, perhaps having a dream in which he is a butterfly! —Trans. John T. Carpenter The poem alludes to the famous episode of “Zhuang Zhou dreaming he is a butterfly” from the second chapter (Of the Equality of Things) of the Daoist classic Zhuangzi. Instead of portraying the philosopher Zhuang Zhou (the proper name of Zhuangzi) slumped over in sleep, as sometimes depicted by Japanese artists, the artist Shinkai has depicted a rotund cat fast asleep. The kyōka poem includes wordplay by making fukami-gusa a pivot word (kakekotoba) first read as part of the phrase nemuri no fukami (fast asleep) and then read as the poetic term fukami-gusa (deep grasses), which is an alternative name for peonies. Cleverly, through verbal allusion, the painter-poet conjures up a picture of peonies and butterflies—a favorite theme of East Asian painting.The artist Hōzōbō Shinkai was a Buddhist monk active in the early Edo period, whose name derives from the type of “monk’s dwelling” (hōzōbō) in certain Kyoto Shingon temples affiliated with the Otokoyama Hachiman Shrine. He studied tea ceremony under Kobori Enshū and is said to have studied calligraphy under the tutelage of Shōkadō Shōjō, one of the top calligraphy masters of the era when Shinkai was growing up. He studied haikai poetry with Matsunaga Teitoku, who inspired him to create of playful forms of kyōka, as represented by the poem here.	豊蔵坊信海筆 夢中の猫図 Title: Dreaming Cat Artist: Hōzōbō Shinkai (Japanese, 1626–1688) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 11 × 16 in.

After his deification, Michizane was revered as a god of agriculture and patron of the falsely accused. One guise in which he is often represented is that of “Totō Tenjin,” or Tenjin on his way to China to visit a Zen Buddhist master. Rosetsu’s vision of Totō Tenjin reflects the artist’s early style, when he was strongly influenced by the deliberate, naturalistic mode of his master, Maruyama Ōkyo (1733–1795), founder of the Maruyama school.	長澤蘆雪筆 渡唐天神図 Title: Tenjin Traveling to China Artist: Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪 (Japanese, 1754–1799) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1787–88 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 35 1/8 × 13 in.

While the poetic texts reward careful reading, the paper on which they appear vies for our attention. The abstract and natural motifs that decorate its surface are rendered in gold and silver powders as well as ink, colors, and cut foil. The album contains a dozen pairs of waka, with the poet’s name given to the right of each text. All were drawn from a famous compilation of classical waka entitled Poetry Competition of Poets of Different Eras (Jidai fudō uta-awase). Authentication slips were later added to identify each calligrapher. However, it is likely that most, if not all, of these attributions are speculative.	伝後陽成天皇他筆 「時不同歌合」和歌色紙帖 Title: Album of Twelve Waka from Poetry Competition of Poets of Different Eras Artist: Calligraphy traditionally attributed to Emperor Go-Yōzei (Japanese, 1571–1617) and eleven others Period: Momoyama period (1573–1615) Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Album of twelve double leaves; ink on gold and silver decorated paper Dimensions: Image: 7 15/16 × 9 3/16 in.

829392.jpg	Wang Ziyou Visiting Dai Andao on a Snowy Evening (Ō Shiyū hō Tai Andō zu)	Kano Sansetsu	Japanese	mid-17th century	According to a story recorded in a fifth-century Chinese compilation of tales, the poet-calligrapher Wang Ziyou (321–379), traveled by boat to visit his friend Dai Andao on a snowy night. However, once he reached his destination, Wang turned around and went home without actually seeing his friend, having fulfilled his interest in taking the trip. In this pristine and spartan scene of snow and distant mountains, in which empty space adds as much atmosphere as the pictorial elements, the poet is a diminutive element in the face of the vastness of the winter landscape.A major Kano-school artist of the early Edo period, Sansetsu produced a number of paintings on Chinese themes in ink monochrome, but he could also work in a manner that combined aspects of ink painting with the decorative, colorful, gold-enriched mode developed by the Kano atelier in the Momoyama period (1573–1615). This starkly evocative landscape, with clearly defined, crystalline rocks often found in his compositions, belongs to the first of these two styles.	狩野山雪筆 王子猷訪戴安道図 Title: Wang Ziyou Visiting Dai Andao on a Snowy Evening (Ō Shiyū hō Tai Andō zu) Artist: Kano Sansetsu (Japanese, 1590–1651) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Two-panel folding screen; ink and gold on paper Dimensions: Image: 61 3/16 × 67 11/16 in.

The poem, inscribed in kana using the scattered-writing (chirashi-gaki) mode, is signed Moshio—a courtesan in the Shimabara pleasure quarters in Kyoto.

Both wear elaborately patterned "small sleeve" kimonos (kosode), in rich colors with flourishes of gold. Screen paintings such as this, often in the format of six-panel folding screens, evidenced the growing popularity of new forms of dance in the Edo period, and an interest in exhibiting the latest trends in women’s fashions. Early examples of this genre appeared in the early seventeenth century, but this example, from perhaps a century later, preserves the format of the earlier works. Such screen paintings also reflected the trend, in hanging-scroll paintings by ukiyo-e artists, of focusing attention on a single figure posed in stylish and elegant attire.	舞伎図屏風 Title: Screen of Two Dancers (Bugi zu byōbu) Artist: Unidentified Artist Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Two-panel folding screen; ink, color, and gold on paper Dimensions: Image: 31 5/8 × 14 3/16 in.

A stand of reeds and grasses on the right make a subtle reference to a shoreline. Details of the heron’s plumage are finely rendered in white pigment; the eyes, beak, legs, and feet of the bird are also delicately detailed, while the pale reflection of the heron in the water is sensitively delineated. The attention to detail is typical of the work of Mitsuoki, one of the most important painters of the Tosa school, who regained the title "head of the court painting bureau," lost during the Momoyama period (1573–1615), for the successive leaders of his studio. Mitsuoki was well known for his refined bird-and-flower paintings, in which he combined traditional elements of Japanese yamato-e painting with techniques gleaned from the popular Kano school patronized by the Tokugawa shoguns, as well as Chinese bird-and-flower compositions.	土佐光起筆 鷺図 Title: Heron Artist: Tosa Mitsuoki (Japanese, 1617–1691) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 38 1/8 × 16 5/16 in.

He was the quintessential chronicler of the history of East Asian painting styles, and this compilation serves as an excellent record of the reception of Chinese and Japanese painting styles in early modern Japan.Kano Tsunenobu is recognized as the last of the great four Kano painters, a roster that also includes masters of the previous generations: Kano Motonobu (1434–1530), Kano Eitoku (1534–1590), and Kano Tan’yū (1602–1674). Though it began as an atelier specializing in Chinese-style painting (kanga), Kano adherents in both Kyoto and Edo also inherited and preserved the traditions of Japanese-style painting, as demonstrated here by several of the exquisite paintings here on indigenous genre themes or a scene from The Tale of Genji.Pictorial topics here include: Monkey kyōgen performances (猿狂言); Chinese lion and peonies (唐獅子牡丹); Monkey on a deer (鹿乗猿); Fish and waterweeds in a lotus pond (蓮池魚藻); Officers with horses (郡馬高官); Small bird and mortar (擂鉢小禽); Gourd and mice (瓜鼠); Millet and quail (粟鶉); Scene from The Tale of Genji (源氏 絵); Deer and autumn foliage (紅葉鹿).	狩野常信筆 人物花鳥団扇画帖 Title: Album of Fan-Shaped Paintings of Figures, Birds and Flowers Artist: Kano Tsunenobu (Japanese, 1636–1713) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 17th–early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Album of twelve double leaves; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 13 3/4 × 19 7/16 in.

829400.jpg	Chrysanthemum	Ogata Kenzan	Japanese	1743	A cluster of white chrysanthemum blossoms and their rich green leaves and stalks stand out against a gold-leafed background. The seal and signature—indicating his age as eighty-one— of the artist Ogata Kenzan, one of the principal masters of the mid-Edo period Rinpa school, appear to the right. The fan painting is striking for the bold but simple design, its limited palette and close-up view of the flowers and leaves, and an overlapping of the blossoms that provides a three-dimensional quality, contrasting with the flatness of the gilded background.Tenzan, younger brother of the renowned painter Ogata Kōrin (1658–1716), was educated in literature and the arts as befitted a well-to-do gentleman, and became a skilled calligrapher, although he is known primarily as a ceramics artist. For his ceramic wares he sometimes collaborated with Kōrin, who provided painted designs to ornament the vessels. However, Kenzan was himself a gifted painter, and created paintings in various formats. This fan reflects the influence of his brother, who produced numerous images of chrysanthemums, inspired by Chinese and Japanese literary references to the flowers associated with the autumn season and longevity.	菊図 Title: Chrysanthemum Artist: Ogata Kenzan (Japanese, 1663–1743) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1743 Culture: Japan Medium: Fan; ink and color on gold-leafed paper Dimensions: Image: 13 1/16 × 21 7/16 in.

829401.jpg	Cranes	Soga Shōhaku	Japanese	ca. 1760	This diptych offers a close-up depiction of auspicious Chinese pictorial subjects—cranes and bamboo, set against a backdrop of pines. The composition draws upon ink painting of the Muromachi period (1392–1573), a tradition inspired by imported Chinese styles. However, in this piece, the cranes—symbols of longevity and good fortune—are rendered with almost humanlike expressions, enhancing their interaction. This expressiveness is a hallmark of the Kyoto painter Soga Shōhaku.One of the major Japanese artists of the eighteenth century, Shōhaku was known for his outlandish behavior, sometimes unrestrained approach to painting, and rebellious personality, qualities that were frequently commented on by his contemporaries. His audacious individuality and departure from convention distinguished him from his peers and have earned his works a renewed high esteem today.	曾我蕭白筆 鶴図 Title: Cranes Artist: Soga Shōhaku (Japanese, 1730–1781) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1760 Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 52 3/4 × 22 1/16 in.

A solitary, red-clad figure sits in a cottage at lower left, looking toward distant mountains shrouded in a soft mist that hovers over the water. The use of mist to create an ambiguous, atmospheric effect, offering a transition from the foreground to the background, is often seen in handscrolls by painters of the Wu school, who flourished during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) in Suzhou, China. Buson established himself as a professional poet and painter in Kyoto, where he was able to access and copy an array of Chinese paintings, allowing him to develop his own refined synthesis of poetic imagery and artistic expression.	与謝蕪村筆 浅絳山水図 Title: Landscape in Light Colors Artist: Yosa Buson (Japanese, 1716–1783) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1775 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 15 1/4 × 24 7/8 in.

Mori Ransai’s polychrome technique belongs to a tradition established by the Chinese painter Shen Nanpin (active 1725–80) in Nagasaki. The inscription, brushed by the Shingon monk Jiun Onkō, echoes a Zen teaching that asserts that all beings, including inanimate objects, can reach enlightenment. It reads:有情非情同時成道ときけばげにうれしくもあるがか 法の友どちI’m truly delighted to hear it said that “Sentient beings or insentient beings, at the same time, can attain the Way [of spiritual enlightenment],” for those that pursue the Buddhist law together.	森蘭斎筆 慈雲飲光賛 薔薇に兎図 Title: Rabbit and Roses Artist: Painting by Mori Ransai (Japanese, 1731–1801) Artist: Inscription by Jiun Onkō (Japanese, 1718–1804) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 42 5/8 × 16 9/16 in.

The branches of blossoming plum on which they balance are entwined with the flowers and leaves of a red camellia—a combination that represents the spring season. This painting is by Gan Ku, best known for his use of the meticulous and detailed technique typical of the followers of Shen Nanpin (active 1725–80), although he developed a rougher, more energetic approach in his later career. Gan Ku, who held courtly and official governmental positions in the early years of the nineteenth century, founded the Kishi school, which perpetuated his combination of various painting styles of the day.	岸駒筆 梅花小禽図 Title: Birds on a PlumTree Artist: Gan Ku (Japanese, 1749–1838) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 1770s–early 1780s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 41 15/16 × 13 1/2 in.

835028.jpg	Daimyo Procession to Edo	Hishikawa School		ca. 1700	This deluxe handscroll painted on silk, captures the pageantry of a grand procession of a daimyo (feudal chieftain) and his entourage en route from their home province to Edo (present-day Tokyo), the military capital of the day. During the Edo period, on a biannual basis, daimyo were required to travel to Edo, where the Tokugawa shogunate had been based since the early seventeenth century, and take up residence there under the sankin kōtai (alternate attendance) system. Hundreds of retainers are shown transporting weapons, ceremonial accoutrements, and personal effects that bespeak the daimyo’s military and financial might. Some are mounted on horses; the daimyo and certain other members of his family are carried in palanquins.In contrast to most depictions of daimyo processions, the scroll opens with a touching scene of a samurai family—a mother nursing a baby, an adult man, a young boy, and two teenage boys—perhaps meant to represent the members of the family that the daimyo must leave behind while he embarks on a trip to Edo. The style in which this genre vignette is handled suggests that the scroll was painted by an artist in the studio of Hishikawa Moronobu, renowned for his role in pioneering the category of painting and printmaking now known as ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”). Another special aspect of this depiction, in the middle section of the scroll, is group of four wakashu (male youths) on elaborately saddled horses attended by grooms; we may assume that these were favorite attendants of the daimyo. Same-sex relationships between elite samurai and wakashu were well documented, but it is rare to see it alluded to in an official work such as this, which is another reason this work can be attributed to an artist in the lineage of Moronobu.	菱川派 「参勤交代図」 Title: Daimyo Procession to Edo Artist: Hishikawa School Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1700 Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: approx. 13 7/16 in. × 27 ft. 4 9/16 in.

Her two tiered chignon is fastened with a white cloth tie and a tortoiseshell comb. She leans against a kotatsu brazier covered by a low table and a cloth for warmth during the winter season. In one hand she holds a long stemmed tobacco pipe (kiseru), and with the other she caresses a kitten. In front of her is a lacquered tray containing a set of utensils used for smoking, along with the pipe of her unseen male client. A three-stringed shamisen lies beside her, its plectrum tucked beneath the strings.

748263.jpg	Monkey on a Rock; Monkey Trainer with Chinese Children and Puppy	Nagasawa Rosetsu	Japanese	late 1790s	Nagasawa Rosetsu, the son of a low-ranking samurai, was adopted by a Kyoto family and studied painting with Maruyama Ōkyo (1733–1795), the leading realist painter of the era. Following Ōkyo’s style, especially his naturalistic depiction of animals, birds, and fish, Rosetsu established a reputation as an eccentric but imaginative and popular artist. In this pair of paintings, he shows, at right, a macaque perched atop a rock entwined with pink-colored vines. In the left scroll, a man, probably a monkey trainer, appears startled by his companions: two young boys and a puppy. Monkeys, children, and puppies are subjects Rosetsu turned to time and again over the course of his relatively brief career.	長澤蘆雪筆 岩上猿・猿回し師唐子狗児図 Title: Monkey on a Rock; Monkey Trainer with Chinese Children and Puppy Artist: Nagasawa Rosetsu (Japanese, 1754–1799) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 1790s Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 44 9/16 × 17 13/16 in.

845805.jpg	Moonlit Landscape	Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪	Japanese	1794–95	One of the most skillful and stylistically diverse ink painters of the late Edo period, Nagasawa Rosetsu has conjured up a moody, atmospheric scene of a mountain landscape illuminated by a moon, rendered in reserve. Wisps of cloud moving across the sky evoke a slightly eerie feeling and call to mind the representation of imaginary dragons of East Asian lore by Rosetsu and others. The bold silhouettes of pine trees contrast with gray washes created using a tsuketatefude 付立筆, a wide brush with long, flexible bristles, to create the contours of the mountainside without outlines. The painting would have been executed in multiple stages, allowing each layer of ink wash to completely dry before the next was applied. The upper expanse of the painting is entirely blank, except for the artist’s signature—cursorily inscribed with a moist brush—and the red accent of his double seal. The exaggeratedly elongated manner of writing Ro 蘆 of his name, as if it comprised two separate characters 艹 and 庵, is a frequently encountered idiosyncrasy of his late-career signature style.Images of moonlit landscapes were a favorite subject of the artist’s oeuvre from the earliest stages of his career, as attested by the paintings attached to a pair of screens in The Met’s collection (1975.268.72, .73), right up until the end of his career, as demonstrated here. During the last five or so years of his life, beginning when he was travelling to Hiroshima and Itsukushima (site of a famous Shinto shrine) in 1794, he created several permutations of the theme of a full moon with clouds. The most famous example is preserved by the Egawa Museum of Art in Hyōgo prefecture, and two variations on the theme have in recent years entered the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Art (acc. nos. 2015.79.164; 2013.31.35). In the former, a pine tree in grey wash is silhouetted directly again the moon; in the Minneapolis examples abstract cloud formations resemble a dragon ascending to the heavens or hover over obscured mountain cliffs.	月夜山水図 Title: Moonlit Landscape Artist: Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪 (Japanese, 1754–1799) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1794–95 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on silk Dimensions: Image: 38 3/8 × 15 15/16 in.

The array of hair ornaments and the elaborate layers of her richly colored robes declare her to be an oiran, or a highly ranked courtesan of the Yoshiwara pleasure quarters. The inscription by the artist quotes the Rinzai Zen monk Takuan Sōhō (1573–1645), weaving in famous Zen sayings: Buddha tried to sell religious law; Our founding patriarch [Bodhidharma] tried to sell the Buddha; We, monks of the Final Age of the Law, try to sell our founding patriarch.

77193.jpg	Beauty on a Veranda in Snow	Sakai Hōitsu 酒井抱一	Japanese	ca. 1794–95	This painting of a slender, pensive-looking courtesan standing on a veranda in a light snowfall is indicative of Hōitsu’s early training in Ukiyo-e painting. The woman’s gesture, of raising the layered collars of her garb with concealed hands to veil the lower part of her face, appears in Ukiyo-e paintings as early as the late seventeenth century. Her hair, adorned with a comb and numerous pins, forms two winglike mounds that characterize the yoko-hyōgo hairstyle popular among high-ranking courtesans in the late Edo period. Hōitsu’s beauty resembles courtesans in paintings by Utagawa Toyoharu (1735–1814), but her figure is more fragile and atten¬uated in appearance than those of that Ukiyo-e master, or even the courtesans in Hōitsu’s earlier Ukiyo-e works, an example of which can be seen in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (acc. no. 11.7837).The seal reading “Teihakushi” beneath Hōitsu’s signature—“Playfully painted by Toryō”—suggests that this work was cre¬ated in the mid-1790s, when he began to use this name, but before 1797, when he took the vows of a Buddhist monk.After entering The Met’s collection in 2020, this work was reunited with a group of eleven hanging scrolls created around the same time by Hōitsu, each of which represents one of the months of the year (2017.283.1–.11). Beauty on a Veranda in Snow represents the missing twelfth month from the set. It is the only one to have been painted in the ukiyo-e style and as such may have been made first, reflecting the influence of Toyoharu, while the others could have been added slightly later, when Hōitsu’s growing interest in the Rinpa master Kōrin began to inform his artistic output. Viewed together, these works reveal much about Hōitsu’s activities from the late 1790s to the 1800s—a crucial juncture in his career as he began to abandon his earlier, experimental immersion in Ukiyo-e, Nanga, and yamato-e (traditional Japanese painting) in favor of Rinpa. This set of twelve paintings, executed in several different painting styles, explores subject matter ranging from typical seasonal motifs to courtly or traditional rituals, as well as at least one classic literary reference (the “Yūgao” chapter of The Tale of Genji, for the sixth month).	雪中縁先美人図 Title: Beauty on a Veranda in Snow Artist: Sakai Hōitsu 酒井抱一 (Japanese, 1761–1828) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1794–95 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 29 1/8 × 12 3/16 in.

Her obi sash is tied in front of her robes rather than behind, the usual practice for courtesans.Utagawa Toyoharu, founder of the Utagawa school of Ukiyo e, produced both finely executed paintings—as seen here—and designs for prints. Shokusanjin, one of the foremost literary arbiters of his era, inscribed the poem to the left of the figure some years after the painting was made. The witty verse is full of clever wordplay and references to centuries old classical literature and the Shinto “patron deity” of the pleasure quarters.	歌川豊春筆 蜀山人（大田 南畝）賛 琴に立美人図 Title: Female Entertainer with a Koto Artist: Painting by Utagawa Toyoharu (Japanese, 1735–1814) Artist: Inscription by Shokusanjin (Ōta Nanpo) (Japanese, 1749–1823) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1785; inscription early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 25 11/16 × 13 3/8 in.

Saichō was the first Japanese patriarch of Tendai Buddhism, whose teachings are based on those of the Chinese Tientai sect. The notably Chinese-inflected portrayal here is a reminder that Saichō traveled to China in 804 and is said to have brought back manuals on Esoteric Buddhism, drawings of portraits of Tientai masters, and ritual accoutrements. Apocryphal lore also suggests that Saichō’s genealogy could be traced back to Chinese emperors.	伝教大師(最澄)像 Title: Portrait of Dengyō Daishi (Saichō) Artist: Unidentified Artist Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 46 1/8 × 22 7/8 in.

845128.jpg	Chinese Poem on an Imaginary Landscape	Yelan Xinggui (Japanese: Yaran Shōkei) 也嬾性圭	Chinese	early 17th century	The Ōbaku Zen master Yelan Xinggui, the calligrapher of this hanging scroll, never made it to Japan to take up a position as abbot of Sōfukuji temple in Nagasaki, though he had been invited and intended to take up the offer. He set sail from China in 1651, but tragically the ship he was on sank and Yelan was lost at sea. Nevertheless, his bold, dynamic calligraphy was cherished by his many disciples in both China and those who had emigrated to Japan.Four columns of cursive calligraphy transcribe one of Yelan’s own poems, one that in the colophon, Yelan playfully suggests that he had composed after taking a late nap using a rock for a pillow. Composed in the set structure of eight lines of seven syllables each, the poem describes the majestic landscape that unfolded before his eyes, including meandering clouds and a gushing waterfall. The calligraphy adheres to Ōbaku convention for creating calligraphic compositions, either poems or Buddhist sayings, in bold but flowing sōsho cursive script, but in this case with only a couple clusters of characters in each column connected by graceful ligatures. In the middle of the second column the work is punctuated by the bold inscription of the characters 千厓 (sengai, using a variant of 崖, meaning “1000 cliffs), with the boldly impressed vertical giving way to the most delicate connecting stroke to the character below. The varying ink tonalities and alternations between thickly brushed and delicately delineated characters creates a sense of rhythm and dynamism.In 1654, when Yinyuan Longqi (Ingen Ryūki, 1592–1673), the Chan master who would establish the Huangbo (Ōbaku) sect in Japan, travelled to its shores, it was a time of very limited contact between Japan and China; and Japan’s interaction with the outside world was strictly regulated, mostly through Nagasaki. Chinese-style temples such as Sōfukuji and Kōfukuji were being built in that entrepôt city of Kyūshū, teachers from China were being sought. Before Yinyuan was invited, however, the Huangbo prelate Yiran Xingrong 逸然性融 (Itsunen Shōyuu,1601–1668) had already encouraged Yelan Xinggui, one of Yinyuan’s top pupils to accept the appointment as head abbot of Sōfukuji. It was only after Yelan lost his life en route to Japan that Yiran then invited Yinyuan to take up the post. Yinyuan had at first turned down the invitation on the grounds of old age; but given the persistence of the invitation from Japan and also in order to honor the unfulfilled cause of Yelan, Yinyuan (Ingen) ultimately decided to make the trip to Japan.The inner box lid was inscribed by the Ōbaku monk Monchū Jōfuku (1739–1829) in 1817, over 165 years after Yelan was supposed to have arrived in Japan. Monchū was not only a prominent Ōbaku master, but also a noted sencha tea master, who was a close associate of Baisaō. Monchū’s attainments as a scholar and calligrapher were also widely acknowledged, and his inscriptions are often found on literati paintings of the day, including those of Ike Taiga and his wife Tokuyama Gyokuran, who were also in Baisaō’s sencha circle. The box inscription here—both the title on the box lid and the lengthy text on the inner lid—in Monchū’s precise standard script (kaisho), is a tour-de-force of calligraphy in its own right, though contrasting with Yelan’s cursive work. Here Monchū vouches for the authenticity of his predecessor’s calligraphy, and relates the tragic circumstances of Yelan’s life and how he lost his life at sea. The inscription reads: “This is a genuine work by the Chan master Yelan from Baoguo Temple on Mount Fenghuang. His secular name was Xinggui, surname Chen, and was from Guangxianli in Futang [present-day Fuqing City, Fujian]. Master Yelan accepted an invitation from Sōfukuji Temple in Nagasaki to travel to our country and bring enlightenment to the East. After the ship set sail, not far from the middle section of Zuojiang River, a storm arose that threatened to overwhelm the ship. Master Yelan donned his kesa (monk’s surplice), sat down solemnly and announced that he was resigned to losing his life. All of a sudden, the boat capsized and he disappeared into the sea. He was truly one of the twenty-three true Dharma heirs of Master Puzhao [Yinyuan Longqi (1592–1673)]” (Trans.

845130.jpg	Chinese Poem to Celebrate a Senior Monk’s Sixtieth Birthday	Duzhan Xingying (Japanese: Dokutan Shōkei) 独湛性瑩	Chinese	late 17th–early 18th century	The Ōbaku Zen monk Duzhan Xingying, better known as Dokutan Shōkei in Japan, has brushed two long and one short columns of bold, Ming-style cursive calligraphy to transcribe a Chinese poem composed in eight lines, five syllables each. Balanced on the left is a half-column of characters, of the same size and style, comprising the calligrapher’s signature. The verse was composed on the occasion of another (unnamed) monk’s sixtieth birthday—no doubt someone senior to Duzhan in the monastic ranks—and eulogizes the subject using natural metaphors such as the clear moonlight (a symbol of Buddhist wisdom) and the vocabulary of the transmission of the Dharma (Buddhist Law). Though brushed with unrelenting energy, each character remains in its own self-contained orbit of energy, with only seven pairs of characters connected by a brushstroke; nowhere are more than two characters connected. The ink tonality remains even throughout. In some characters the influence of Song literati calligraphers such as Huang Tingjian (1045–1105) can be detected, such as the way the downward slanting strokes of the character zen 全 , just below the middle of the second column, are boldly drawn. For that character, the tip of the brush hidden upon entry and also as it finishes the stroke, without pointed tips, but rather with nearly squared-off edges. Then the tip of the the next character shō 彩, creating a delightful contrast of delicacy and boldness as well as ink density. The alternation of “dry” and “wet” brush marks as the calligrapher allows his brush to go dry before re-inking is effectively brought to bear throughout the composition, and lends a sensation of spontaneity to the composition.The poem can be deciphered and translated as follows:六旬寫仙籙兼寫正法堂桂月光天德水雲護寳坊祖燈光益熾心地印全彰華藏門大啓普薰法乳香右蒲茅獨湛性瑩和南草For your venerable sixtieth birthdayI inscribe an account of a sage, While also paying homage to our Dharma Hall.The mid-autumn osmanthus moon illuminates Heaven’s virtue As waves of clouds form a canopy protecting our sacred monastery.The light of the lantern of the Patriarchs burns ever so brightly, And the seal of the transmission of mind manifests itself completely.

Xiaohan Du)Duzhan (Dokutan) was born in Xinghua prefecture of Fujian province. He followed his master Yinyuan (Ingen) to Japan, and became his Dharma heir in the year 1664. He was the founding abbot of Shosan Hōrinji Temple 初山宝林寺 in Shizuoka prefecture, and then was appointed the fourth-generation head of the Ōbaku sect in 1682, as alluded to in one of the seals impressed on this work. Duzhan was famous for practicing the teaching of both Zen and Pure Land sects, and came to known in Japan as Nenbutsu Dokutan 念仏独湛, or “Dokutan who recites the Nenbutsu” (repeating the name of Amida Buddha as an act of devotion).	五言律詩（Gogon risshi, Chinese poem in five-character lines） Title: Chinese Poem to Celebrate a Senior Monk’s Sixtieth Birthday Artist: Duzhan Xingying (Japanese: Dokutan Shōkei) 独湛性瑩 (Chinese, 1628–1706) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th–early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 50 9/16 × 16 in.

845138.jpg	Section of a Handscroll with Waka and Underpainting of Pines	Calligrapher Hon'ami Kōetsu 本阿弥光悦	Japanese	early 17th century	This detached section of a long poetry handscroll was remounted to serve as a self-sufficient calligraphic composition, with a single complete waka (31-syllable court verse) inscribed atop an abstract landscape of pine trees painted in gold. The calligraphy is in the distinctive style of Hon’ami Kōetsu, rendered in a dynamic yet ever so elegant array of “scattered writing” (chirashigaki) rhythmically composed in nine columns—some long, some comprising but a single character—that playfully regroups the 5-7-5-7-7 syllable structure of the poem into a new composition. The overall balance of this constellation of kanji and kana characters works well, with a focal point of the composition in the cluster of boldly inked characters “aki no tsuyu” 秋の露. These three characters reveal two other trademark features of Kōetsu’s hand. First, he has reversed the two parts of the character aki 秋、so that 火 is on the left, rather than 禾. Second, he has rendered the particle no in a highly cursive form of the phonetically equivalent character nō 濃, in order to make it as prominent as the kanji characters that precede and follow it.The anonymous poem is from Book 11, “Love,” of the Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern (Kokin wakashū, no. 545), and evokes the imagery of a woman crying into the sleeve of her robe, distraught over lost or unrequited love. It reads: ゆうされは いとゝひかたき わか袖に 秋の露さへ おきそはりつゝYū sareba itodo higatakiwa ga sode niaki no tsuyu saeokisawari-tsutsuAs evening descends,it becomes ever harderto dry my tear-soaked sleeve,as the autumn dew also dampens it drop by drop.

845141.jpg	Portrait of Sen no Rikyū with his Death Poem	Painting by Unidentified artist		early 17th century	This solemn portrait of the revered tea master Sen no Rikyū (1522–1591)—seated on a tatami mat, dressed in the robes of a Buddhist monk, wearing a cloth hat, and holding a closed fan—belies the tragic circumstances it commemorates. Brushed above the portrait is Rikyū’s death poem, composed just before he followed through on the command of the most powerful military leader of the day, Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536–1598), to commit ritual suicide (seppuku), on the twenty-eighth day of the second month of 1591 at the warlord’s Jurakudai Palace. Historians still debate over the reasons the megalomaniacal military leader ordered the foremost master of tea to take his own life, though it seems that at least one motive was that Hideyoshi could not tolerate anyone rivaling his own fame and cultural prestige.For the tragic occasion Rikyū’s composed a “departing this world” poem (jisei no ku), also sometimes referred to as a “bequeathed Buddhist verse” (yuige), the term used for the death poem of a monk, which in this case comprises four lines of four-character Chinese verse and a 31-syllable Japanese waka poem. For this anonymously painted portrait, Rikyū’s death poem was transcribed by Joshinsai Sōsa, the seventh Grand Tea Master of Omotesenke, one of the foremost tea masters of his generation, who restored the fortunes of the family of tea masters. Relevant to understanding the significance of this work, Joshinsai managed to negotiate the acquisition of what was believed to be the only surviving version of Rikyū’s death poem written in the tea master’s own hand. Joshinsai managed to acquire the manuscript from the Fuyuki family, prominent Edo merchants, in time for the 150th anniversary of Rikyū’s death, celebrated in 1740.Numerous portraits of Rikyū survive from early modern times, since tea masters and practitioners of all schools would occasionally want to display a memorial portrait of the person considered to be the founder of tea as practiced in Japan. Perhaps the most famous of all is the memorial portrait commissioned in 1595, four years after Rikyū’s death, that is attributed to Hasegawa Tōhaku and inscribed by Shun’oku Sōen 春屋宗園 (1529–1611), a Zen master at Daitokuji Temple and one of Rikyū's spiritual advisors. That revered painting—treated almost as though it were a religious icon—is a treasured holding of the Omotesenke school of tea. That work also established the precedent of having portraits of Rikyū inscribed by prominent Zen or tea ceremony masters. Joshinsai’s inscription here, in its somewhat idiosyncratic use of kana characters in the waka poem, can be traced back to an early transcription of Rikyū’s death poem by his grandson Sen Sōtan (1578–1658). Rikyū’s own transcription of his death poem, as mentioned above, is still said to be in the possession of the Omotesenke school, but it has never been placed on public display or made available for study to our knowledge. We can assume that Sōtan’s transcription resembles the original, and has become a revered manuscript in its own right. The inscription can be deciphered as follows, reading the columns of characters from left to right, reverse of normal order:[Chinese verse]人生七十 力圍希咄吾這宝剣祖佛共殺[Waka poem]提ル 我カ得具そくの 一太刀今此時そ 天に抛Jinsei shichijūRiki-i-ki totsuwaga kono hōkensobutsu tomo ni korosuHissaguruwaga egusoku nohitotsu tachiima konotoki zoten ni nage-utsuIn a life of seventy years, after exerting myself to the limit, now, with my own sacred sword I kill both patriarchs and the Buddha.Carrying in my hands the only weapon I own—this one long sword—and at this moment, alas, I abandon it to the heavens.

845146.jpg	Letter to Yamagishi Hanzan	Matsuo Bashō 松尾芭蕉	Japanese	dated 1685 (Jōkyō 2)	Matsuo Bashō, the renowned peripatetic poet of seventeenth-century Japan, did more than any other to elevate the esteem and spread the popularity of the seventeen-syllable seasonal verse form haikai—now called haiku. The opening verse of a string of linked verses (renga), was originally called a hokku, comprising three lines with five-seven-five syllables respectively. This poetic form, practiced by Bashō and his many pupils and an infinite number of followers of later generations, injected wit and humor into Japanese versifying and encouraged anyone with a literary disposition to try their hand at composing a verse when the opportunity arose. This letter was brushed by Bashō and sent to Yamagishi Hanzan 山岸半残 (1654–1726), the master’s nephew who also became a close disciple. Hanzan, whose given name was Jūzaemon 十左衛門, was born of samurai stock in Iga, Ueno (present Mie prefecture), where the master himself was born. Hanzan achieved a certain renown as one of the principal poets of the Bashō school from Iga. A good number of Bashō personal missives survive, mostly addressed to disciples who had asked for comments or critiques of their poems, as is the case here (see below). As is usually the case with Bashō’s correspondence, it is inscribed in a relaxed, informal epistolary style, which can be characterized as sotsui 卒意 (without deliberation). Typically in missives to his pupils, he gives extra space on the paper to places where hokku are inscribed, as if to give them breathing space and visual prominence (here, just to the right of the middle of the letter), featuring the master’s comments on Hanzan’s poem:禰宜独 人は桜の まばら哉Negi hitori/ hito wa sakura no/ mabara kanaA Shinto priest by himself— since there are so few people amid scattered cherry blossoms.(Trans.

845147.jpg	Hokku poem “On a withered branch”	Matsuo Bashō 松尾芭蕉	Japanese	probably 1680s	This poem, brushed in his own hand in idiosyncratic but dynamic and swirling cursive calligraphy, melding kanji (Chinese characters) and kana (Japanese phonetic writing), is a seventeen-syllable hokku, now known as haiku, by Matsuo Bashō. Bashō is certainly one of the most famous of all Japanese poets, both in Japan as well as around the world. The modern international haiku poetry movement can be traced back to his popularization of this succinct poetic form. The poem is one of Basho’s most famous, and one that he often inscribed on vertical poetry slips (tanzaku), as here, or on larger sheets of paper for mounting, sometimes with his own illustration or to accompany someone else’s painting. Here, the brilliant orange background may call to mind the color of the setting sun, but the plum branch is about to burst into bloom, creating (pleasurable) a visual dissonance with the meaning of the poem. The poem is signed Tosei 桃青, one of Bashō’s noms de plume, and reads: 枯枝に からすとまりたるや 秋の暮桃青Kareeda ni karasu tomaritaru ya aki no kureOn a withered branch,a crow has come to perch—at dusk in autumn. —Tōsei(Trans. John T. Carpenter)As the careful reader will note, the second line of the Japanese original here violates the requirement of a five-seven-five syllable structure, but if you are the greatest teacher of hokku, that is permitted. Though the master later created variants of this poem. The poem first appeared in the Eastern Diary (Azuma nikki 東日記), a poetry collection compiled by his pupil Ikenishi Gonsui 池西言水 in 1680 and published the following year. There, the second line was still nine syllables, but varied slightly: karasu no tomaritari.	発句短冊 「枯枝に」 (Hokku tanzaku, “Kare eda ni”)「枯れ枝に」の句 ( Kareeda ni no ku) Title: Hokku poem “On a withered branch” Artist: Matsuo Bashō 松尾芭蕉 (Japanese, 1644–1694) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: probably 1680s Culture: Japan Medium: Poetry slip (tanzaku) mounted as a hanging scroll: ink on paper decorated with gold Dimensions: Image: 14 5/8 × 2 5/16 in.

845148.jpg	Passage from “A Modern-Day Wen Xuan: Selections of Refined Literature”	Morikawa Kyoriku (Kyoroku) 森川許六	Japanese	after 1705	This hanging scroll records reflections on Japanese poetry by Morikawa Kyoriku, a samurai of the Hikone clan who was also a noted poet of haikai (seventeen-syllable verse) in the style of Matsu Bashō, and recognized as one of the master’s ten top pupils. The celebrated poet-calligrapher brushed seven columns of highly cursive, somewhat idiosyncratic, but eminently legible characters—mostly kana (Japanese phonetic writing) with an admixture of kanji (Chinese characters) that punctuate the composition with slightly denser forms. For instance, at the bottom of the second column from the right, we see the characters waka no michi 和哥の道, or the “way of Japanese poetry,” are melded into a column of mostly kana. And as we scan the text elsewhere for easily recognizable phrases, we realize that this is a prose commentary not on haikai, as we would expect, but on waka (courtly verse in thirty-one syllables) and the status of Japanese poetry in general. Reading a few more phrases, we can see that the entire passage seems to riff off famous statements about waka included in the “Kana Preface” of the first imperially commissioned waka anthology, The Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern (Kokin wakashū, 905). In places it quotes verbatim from the “Kana Preface,” especially the famous phrase, “It is song that moves heaven and earth without effort, stirs emotions in the invisible spirits and gods, brings harmony to the relations between men and women, and calms the hearts of fierce warriors.” (Trans. Helen Craig McCullough). But Kyoriku injects a pessimistic note by commenting, “…That may be the case, but in this latter age, the primary obstacle to the way of Japanese poetry is money” (Saredo sue no yo ni atatte, waka no michi ni taisuru mono wa kane nari). The passage derives from the final section of the essay on “Vocabulary of the Four Seasons” (Shiki no kotoba 四季辞) from Kyoriku’s influential anthology of haibun (witty prose writings on literary topics), including passages by Bashō and his pupils, entitled A Modern-Day Wen Xuan: Selections of Refined Literature (Fūzoku monzen 風俗文選), which was published in 1705—providing a terminus post quem for this calligraphic excerpt. The poet-calligrapher notes in his signature that he inscribed this hanging scroll while at his “retreat” (kankyo)—which we know from other sources was in Hikone City—on the eastern shore of Lake Biwa, to the northeast of Kyoto. Kyoriku does not tell us what inspired his little sketch, almost abstract in its simplicity, but we can safely assume that it was meant to depict one of the juxtapositions of rocks along a stone path found in the carefully tended “Fudaraku” (Potalaka) garden at Ryōtanji Zen temple, also in Hikone. Kyoriku, who was also a skilled artist said to have been trained as a young man in the Kano atelier under Yasunobu (1614–1685), famously painted the sliding-door panels (fusuma-e) at Ryōtanji, still a popular tourist destination to this day. Interestingly, Kyoriku gave painting lessons to his poetry teacher Bashō at one point, and the great haikai master wrote to his pupil, “In painting you were my teacher; in poetry I taught you and you were my disciple. My teacher’s paintings are imbued with such profundity of spirit and executed with such marvelous dexterity that I could never approach their mysterious depths.” (Trans. Donald Keene, World within Walls, p. 139)	『風俗文選』より (Fūzoku monzen yori) Title: Passage from “A Modern-Day Wen Xuan: Selections of Refined Literature” Artist: Morikawa Kyoriku (Kyoroku) 森川許六 (Japanese, 1656–1715) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: after 1705 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 46 15/16 × 11 1/8 in.

845155.jpg	Mount Fuji	Ike no Taiga 池大雅	Japanese	1760s?	Japan’s grandest peak, with its contours rendered in outlines of pale gray ink with washes to subtly suggest volume, sits above a landscape of rice paddies stretched out before it—employing an unusual sense of perspective that give the impression that the artist was viewing the scene from faraway and above. The central focus of the composition is the area of rice paddies in the middle ground with the subdivided plots (ase 畦) drawing the eye with their bold, abstracted depiction. The overall composition, disarmingly simple at first glance, strikes one as different from anything else in in Ike Taiga’s corpus, though comparisons can be made with depictions of Fifth Month scenes from sets of paintings done by the artist of the theme of Mount Fuji in Twelve Months. Looking closely the brushwork is firm and well controlled. Some of Taiga’s students, including Aoki Shukuya created similar compositions based on Taiga’s model, as did Okada Beisanjin a generation later.The monk and Nanga painter Geppō (1760–1839), considered third in the Taiga lineage after Shukuya praised this painting on the box inscription, adding to its cachet as a work that was emulated by Taiga’s pupils.	富嶽図 (Fugaku zu) Title: Mount Fuji Artist: Ike no Taiga 池大雅 (Japanese, 1723–1776) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1760s?

845156.jpg	Amaranthus and Mynah Bird	Kakutei 鶴亭 (Kaigan Jōkō 海眼浄光)	Japanese		Kaigan Jōkō spent his early years as a priest at Shōfukuji 聖福寺, an Ōbaku Zen temple in his native Nagasaki, where he also studied painting under Kumashiro Yūhi 熊代熊斐 (1712–1773), the most prominent Japanese student of the Chinese émigré painter Shen Quan (Shen Nanpin; 1682–1760), who had spent several years in Nagasaki in the early 1730s. Yūhi nurtured numerous students in Nagasaki, giving rise to a network of painters that would come to be known as the Nanpin school or Nagasaki school. Yūhi’s two top disciples, Kaigan Jōkō (better known by his sobriquet Kakutei) and Sō Shiseki 宋紫石 (1715–1786) are credited with transmitting the school’s colorful, naturalistic style of bird-and-flower painting to the cities of Kyoto and Edo, respectively. In this picture, Kakutei depicts a mynah bird flying above a rock and large pink-colored amaranthus, the characters of whose Chinese-origin Japanese name, ganraikō, literally means “crimson of the goose’s arrival,” referring to the plant’s autumnal transformation. Moving away from the Shen Nanpin derived styles promoted by his teacher, here Kakutei uses the so-called boneless method to depict the amaranthus’s leaves without contour lines. Kakutei’s influence on better known painters in eighteenth-century Kyoto such as Itō Jakuchū and Ike Taiga is often noted.	雁来紅に叭々鳥図 (Ganraikō ni hahachō zu) Title: Amaranthus and Mynah Bird Artist: Kakutei 鶴亭 (Kaigan Jōkō 海眼浄光) (Japanese, 1722–1785) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; color on paper Dimensions: Image: 52 5/8 × 13 1/16 in.

845157.jpg	Lady Chiyono	Maruyama Ōkyo 円山応挙	Japanese	1773	This simply but deftly and sensitively painted figure of a young women who has just dropped a water bucket captures a moment from the medieval Japanese legend of Lady Chiyono, a woman of high birth who achieved Buddhist enlightenment when she saw the moon reflected in the spilled water. The master painter Maruyama Ōkyo, one of the most powerful and prolific painters in Kyoto of the eighteenth century, has left most of the composition blank, and has discarded an attempt to create a feeling of three-dimensionality through shading (though he had mastered a more realistic style of painting). Lady Chiyono was the daughter of Adachi Yasumori 安達泰盛 (1231–1285), a prominent samurai who served as a governor of Mutsu (now the Tohoku region) during the time of the Kamakura Shōgunate. She also became the second wife of the Kanezawa Sanetoki金沢実時 (1224–1276), the great scholar who belonged the Hōjō clan, who served as regents to the Shogun. After her husband's death, Chiyoni became a nun in Kyoto, where she diligently practiced Zen meditation but apparently made little progress towards spiritual enlightenment. Then, according to legend and as depicted in Ōkyo’s painting, one day she was bringing water back from the river in an old bucket, and noticed the reflection of the moon in it. Then all of a sudden the bottom of the bucket fell out, causing water to spill everywhere and dissolve the moon’s reflection. At that moment, Chiyono suddenly realized that all perceptions she had of reality and of herself were similarly insubstantial just like the reflection of the moon. And these ideas of herself were being held together by her own delusions, which were just as flimsy as her bucket. Her experience is immortalized in a famous waka (31-syllable poem) that anyone viewing this painting at the time it was made would have recalled the poem and religious incident, even without it being inscribed on the blank space of the painting: In this way and that I tried to save the old pailSince the bamboo strip was weakening and about to breakUntil at last the bottom fell out.No more water in the pail!No more moon in the water!(Trans. Paul Reps, Zen Flesh, Zen) Incidentally, the biographies of Chiyono and the prominent nun Mugai Nyodai (b. 1223), founder of Keiaiji Temple, have been tangled up and confused over the centuries, even today, but it seems reasonable to assume that both shared the same given name as children, and then their biographers got things confused. It is common to see in biographical dictionaries that Mugai’s name as a child was Chiyono, and she was also listed as the he daughter of Adachi Yasumori. But Mugai Nyodai according to most accounts was supposedly born in 1223, so if her father was definitely born in 1231, then something is amiss in the recordkeeping.	千代能姫図 (Chiyono-hime zu) Title: Lady Chiyono Artist: Maruyama Ōkyo 円山応挙 (Japanese, 1733–1795) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1773 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 37 3/4 × 15 5/16 in.

845158.jpg	Rats on a Scholar’s Desk	Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪	Japanese	ca. 1794–95	A trio of rats crawls upon and under a scholar’s low red-lacquer table, with piles of stitch-bound books scattered over its surface and beneath. A ceramic vase holds peacock and hawk feathers and a stem of red coral, all appropriate for a decoration of a desk of a literatus. But spiders have spun webs, suggesting it has been a long while since anyone consulted these tomes. Punctilious brushwork creates an effect that is at once realistic yet decorative. This composition, so colorful and playful, is quite unlike anything else in Rosetsu’s known corpus (though the full range of the artist’s output remains to be investigated), and seems to be inspired by Shanghai-style paintings or woodblock prints and book illustrations popular in the late Edo period, which had been transmitted through Nagasaki. The polychromy seems to correspond to works of the artist’s Hiroshima period (1794–95) and shortly after, by which time he had a cultivated a wealthy clientele for colorful paintings on silk, for example the Mount Hōrai paintings of this period and the Tokyo National Museum’s “Chinese Beauty.”	楓鼠図 (Fūso zu) Title: Rats on a Scholar’s Desk Artist: Nagasawa Rosetsu 長澤蘆雪 (Japanese, 1754–1799) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1794–95 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 50 3/16 × 16 1/4 in.

845159.jpg	Banana Leaves	Itō Jakuchū 伊藤若冲	Japanese	1790s	In a bold, graphic composition, overlapping leaves of a banana plant with have been rendered in expanses of pale gray ink and the so-called sujime-gaki, or “white-line drawing,technique. To achieve this effect, the artist carefully applied moist brushstrokes to the soft and absorbent gasenshi paper in such a way as to leave a narrow, unpainted space between them, resembling a white line. Itō Jakuchū was counted as one of the Three Eccentrics of the Edo period, together with Soga Shōhaku (1730– 1781) and Nagasawa Rosetsu (1754–1799). Born the eldest son of a wholesale grocer in Kyoto, Jakuchū inherited the family business and ran it for more than fifteen years. It was not until he reached his late thirties that he began to paint full-time.The round seal reading “Lay Buddhist devotee Jakuchū” is the one the artist cherished and used most, especially during his late career, but it also appears on works created by his pupils, so caution must be exercised in separating studio creations from those of the master. For reasons unknown, there has always been a break in the circular outline on the left side of this seal; a second small break, on the right side, begins to appear in later works, as here. The vertical rectangular seal above it, “Seal of Tō (Fujiwara),” was also a favorite of Jakuchū’s. The seal in the lower left corner reading Senga zeppitsu can be interpreted to mean, “a thousand paintings, each one [created as if it were] my last one”—certainly a sentiment shared by many artists.	芭蕉図 (Bashō zu) Title: Banana Leaves Artist: Itō Jakuchū 伊藤若冲 (Japanese, 1716–1800) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1790s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 43 1/2 × 16 7/8 in.

853238.jpg	The Bodhisattva Five-Topknot Monju (Manjushri) (Gokei Monju Bosatsu zō)	Unidentified artist		probably 18th century	Depicted here is Monju, the bodhisattva of transcendent wisdom, riding a lion.This particular iconography is referred to as Gokei Monju, referring to his Five topknots. Seated cross-legged atop the lion on a lotus, Monju holds a sword in one hand and the Perfection of Transcendent Wisdom Sutra (Sanskrit: Prajnaparamita) in the other. Monju’s pale skin is adorned with gold jewelry and green and pink clothing, even the topknots are tied with a golden string as two halos, blue and green with gold, further mark his divinity. The five top knots he sports represent the Five Wisdom Buddhas: Ashuku (Sanskrit: Akshobhya), Amida (Amitabha), Fukujōju (Amoghasiddhi), Hōshō (Sanskrit: Ratnasambhava), and Dainichi (Sanskrit: Mahavairocana). The lion he rides has malachite fur, golden adornments and four lotus pads that it walks across. In most surviving examples of Gokei Monju, the bodhisattva and the lion face to the left whereas in this case both facing to the right. This is probably the result of the painting’s use as the right scroll of a triptych in which the Historical Buddha Shaka would usually feature as the central figure.	五髪文殊菩薩像 Title: The Bodhisattva Five-Topknot Monju (Manjushri) (Gokei Monju Bosatsu zō) Artist: Unidentified artist Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: probably 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, gofun, gold pigment, and kirikane (cut gold leaf) on silk Dimensions: Image: 45 5/8 × 16 5/8 in.

853239.jpg	Triad of the Medicine Master Buddha Yakushi (Bhaisajya Buddha)	Unidentified artist		17th or 18th century	This painting depicts a rare Japanese painted depiction of Yakushi (Sanskrit: Bhaisajyaguru), the Medicine Master Buddha, an iconography better known in Japan through sculpture. Commonly referred to as a Yakushi triad, the central Buddha is shown with two attendants: Nikkō (Suryaprabha), the bodhisattva of the sun (to the right), and Gakkō (Candraprabha), the bodhisattva of the moon (to the left). Here, Yakushi as the central figure of worship, is significantly larger than the bodhisattvas. He cradles a small medicine jar in one hand, while the other is raised in a rare form of the “Have no fear” (abhaya varada) mudra both of which identify him as the medicine Buddha. The bodhisattvas are ornately decorated and hold staffs with tips that cradle the sun and moon.Although Yakushi is also known for Beryl radiance and frequently depicted with blue skin in India and Tibet in this painting his golden skin is a reflection of the Chinese standard and an example of the transmission of Buddhism from China to Japan through Korea. Introduced to Japan in the seventh century A.D, Yakushi still has relevance in death memorials, such as the ‘Thirteen Buddha’ memorial where Yakushi is the deity of the forty-ninth day after death.	薬師三尊 Title: Triad of the Medicine Master Buddha Yakushi (Bhaisajya Buddha) Artist: Unidentified artist Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 17th or 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, metallic paint, and kirikane (cut gold) on silk Dimensions: Image: 40 × 19 in.

853198.jpg	People Dancing	Unidentified		early 17th century	Men in boldly patterned kimono, many holding golden fans with a rising sun motif, dance in time to the music, performing furyū-odori, fashionable, modern dances popular at festivals in the early to mid-seventeenth century, and also enjoyed at private gatherings, as depicted here. In the garden of a grand samurai residence, male guests dance to the music of small hand drums (tsutsumi), a larger shime-daiko drum held by a boy and played by an older samurai, a bamboo transverse flute (shinobue), and three-stringed shamisen played by two minstrels in the center. A blind shamisen minstrel is arriving to accompany them.Many of the established forms of entertainment of the Edo period had their roots in ancient forms of court and agricultural rituals in which performers donned colorful kimono or elaborate costumes, fancifully decorated hats, and sometimes even masks representing sacred animals or supernatural beings. Such performances had both a religious and practical function: they helped exorcise evil spirits while inviting benevolent deities to bestow good fortune on a household or community. The social interaction of the rituals helped forge closer community ties, yet they also fulfilled for those who performed, joined in, or simply watched, an individual’s basic human need for emotional catharsis and temporary escape from daily cares, especially during times of famine or pandemic—which were all too common during the Edo period.The masks and costumes used in folk dances permit individuals to transform their everyday appearances and personalities, allowing traditional reserve to break down and emotions to be freely expressed. Part of the classic definition of play, as proposed by the sociologist Johan Huizinga, is the opportunity it offers for “stepping out of real life into a temporary sphere of activity with a disposition all its own” (Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture, Boston, 1955, p. 9). Even if there is no pretense of a profound religious motive, the use of mask and costume reflects a basic human instinct to transcend the mundane world through simulation of the divine or otherworldly.The unknown artist was very likely a machi-eshi, or town-based painter with no close affiliation to any particular school of painting. Bright colors and detailed textile patterns such as those seen here were frequently used in genre paintings depicting the various classes of Edo-period society and the celebration of various festivals. Such images are precursors of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”) scenes of the pleasures of urban life that began to flourish in the later years of the seventeenth century and grew in popularity and sophistication over the next two hundred years.	群舞図 (Gunbu zu) Title: People Dancing Artist: Unidentified Artist Date: early 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 30 3/4 × 41 3/4 in.

853200.jpg	Monk Zhaozhou and Dog, with Geese and Mynah	Unkoku Tōeki	Japanese	first half 17th century	This work combines three seemingly unrelated subjects in a single, multi-scroll composition, a format common in early Zen devotional painting and adopted widely during the sixteenth century. The central scroll illustrates the Chan monk Zhaozhou Congshen (Jōshū Jūshin, 778–897), perhaps best remembered for his response to the koan “Does a dog have a Buddha nature?” He replied simply, “Wu,” meaning on one level “no.” In a Zen mindset, however, this may have been a short verbal signal to stop the logical process of trying to find an answer. Zhaozhou is flanked by so-called bird-and-flower subjects, originating in China—two geese and autumnal reeds at right, and a mynah atop a tree stump at left. The artist Tōeki belonged to the Unkoku school, painters-in-attendance to the powerful Mōri clan.	雲谷等益筆 趙州狗子・芦雁・叭々鳥図 Title: Monk Zhaozhou and Dog, with Geese and Mynah Artist: Unkoku Tōeki (Japanese, 1591–1644) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: first half 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Set of three hanging scrolls; ink on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 42 3/8 × 18 1/4 in.

853202.jpg	Archbishop Henjō (Sōjō Henjō zu), from the Dōon Version of the Thirty-Six Poetic Immortals	Iwasa Matabei 岩佐又兵衛	Japanese	1620s–1630s	In ancient Japanese court society, poetry was the quintessential literary experience. Idealized and deeply admired, poets were often commemorated in portraiture. In the early eleventh century, Fujiwara Kintō (966–1041) selected thirty-six “poetic immortals” (kasen) from the past, and their images became a popular theme in Yamato-e, traditional Japanese painting. This imaginary portrait of Archbishop Henjō was originally part of a set of album leaves comprising all thirty-six poets. Some of the leaves feature the seal of the painter Iwasa Matabei, who broke away for the orthodoxy of the Kano and Tosa studios to create his own distinctive style of depicting the human figure. For instance, here he has rendered the aged monk with a wrinkled forehead, droopy eyes, sagging cheeks, and downturned mouth that convey melancholy—a far cry from the stylized poet portraits of previous centuries. Matabei’s poet portraits are expressive and compelling. Similarly impressive is the detailing of the crystal Buddhist rosary beads, the archbishop’s silk damask cloak and kesa surplice.Above the portrait of the poet is one of his famous poems from his younger years on the theme of love. The text is transcribed in four columns of calligraphy, mostly kana (Japanese syllables) with an admixture of kanji (Chinese characters). On the far right is the poet’s name and clerical title, Sōjō Henjō 僧正遍照, inscribed in bold semi-cursive script. The poem reads: 我やとはみちもなきまてあれにけりつれなき人をまつとせしまにWaga yado wamichi mo naki made arenikeritsurenaki hito omatsu to seshi ma ni The path to my hut,completely overgrown,has now all but disappeared, while I waited to no avail for an out-of-touch lover.

For the central scroll, Mitsuoki—the esteemed head of the Tosa school of traditional Japanese-style painting—rendered the patriarch of Japanese poetry, Kakinomoto no Hitomaro (ca. 660–724). Mitsunari, Mitsuoki’s son, painted Lady Ise (ca. 875–ca. 938), dressed in gorgeous court robes in the scroll at right. The court lady and poet Ono no Komachi (ca. 825–ca. 900), depicted with a water basin, is the work of Mitsutaka, the Tosa master’s grandson. This set of portraits celebrates the high regard for poetry in Japanese cultural history.	土佐光起・光成・光高筆 人麻呂・伊勢・小町図 Title: Portraits of Three Famous Poets: Kakinomoto no Hitomaro, Lady Ise, and Ono no Komachi Artist: Tosa Mitsuoki (Japanese, 1617–1691) Artist: Tosa Mitsunari (Japanese, 1646–1710) Artist: Tosa Mitsutaka (Japanese, 1675–1710) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1691 Culture: Japan Medium: Triptych of hanging scrolls: ink, color, gold and silver on silk Dimensions: Image: 39 1/2 × 17 3/8 in.

853208.jpg	Peonies	Fukae Roshū 深江蘆舟	Japanese	early to mid-18th century	A subtly colored but glorious array of peonies, white, pink and red, are rendered against leaves rendered in mottled ink and color washes. To add a deluxe touch, in places gold pigment was dripped into the outlines of the leaves as they were being painted. As with other paintings from this group, no doubt once mounted as a pair of six-panel screens, Roshū draws on ink painting techniques of previous Rinpa masters. Rather than working in shades of gray and black, he has employed the tarashikomi technique, in which mottled washes create gradations of mineral pigments that overlap and blend together to evoke pictorial depth and emotion. The colors of the flowers are modulated: dark red stands out from the pale red background; deep purple accents stand out against pale pink; white gofun (ground oyster-shell) pigment accents the grayish petals. While archaic in flavor for his time, still his paintings on floral themes have an enduring charm. His other known surviving paintings take up the theme of the Mount Utsu scene from the Tales of Ise (2015.300.91).Other than his life dates, we know next to nothing about the artist’s biography. Active in the early 1700s, his small surviving corpus shows that he worked in an archaic Sōtatsu mode of a century before. Some sources speculate that he trained with the Rinpa master Ōgata Kōrin with whom his life span overlapped, but that cannot be confirmed.Originally a pair of six-fold screens, remounted as hanging scrolls; other examples from the same set are found in the in Feinberg Collection, Harvard University (Fig. 2); St. Louis Art Museum (Fig. 3); Freer-Sackler Gallery, National Museum of Asian Art; Narazaki Muneshige Collection, and Hosomi Museum.	牡丹図 (Botan zu) Title: Peonies Artist: Fukae Roshū 深江蘆舟 (Japanese, 1699–1757) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early to mid-18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Panel of a folding screen remounted as a hanging scroll; ink, color and gold on paper Dimensions: Image: 43 5/8 × 18 3/4 in.

858249.jpg	Crabs and Peonies	Itō Jakuchū 伊藤若冲	Japanese	mid-18th century, before 1766	This double-sided, freestanding screen, known as a tsuitate in Japanese, features a pair of ink paintings by one of early-modern Japan’s most imaginative and celebrated painters, Itō Jakuchū. On the front side of the screen, Jakuchū offers a slow, quiet scene, where three crabs of varying sizes—a large red king crab and a pair of smaller Japanese mitten crabs—seem to pass idly by one another on a grassy beach. The varied textures and colors of the crabs’ bodies serve as a playground for one of Jakuchū’s favorite ink-painting techniques, the so-called boneless method, mokkotsu, where he forgoes contour lines in favor of using carefully gradated and layered ink washes to define form. Jakuchū’s deliberate layering of washes and delineation of the red-tinted gray shell, spiny legs, eyes, and claws of the king crab contrast with his wetter, more exuberant treatment of the smaller crabs’ distinctively furry bodies, described variously by taking advantage of the splitting of hairs at the tip of his brush. On the verso, Jakuchū takes the viewer on an equally playful but profoundly contrasting exploration, this one grounded in his dynamic linework. Spirited and supremely confident, Jakuchū shows a grassy embankment where a clump of peonies is buffeted violently by the wind, its lower leaves and heavy blossoms twisted around a garden rock. His brush dances along the paper, creating repeating arcing shapes so that each ruffled petal and leaf of the peony, each blade of grass, all respond in unison to a strong, whipping wind. Like the crabs, the peony composition exemplifies Jakuchū’s keen sense of tonal balance. Where dark dots and flicks add texture to the crabs, here he anchors his composition with the jet-black contours and stippling of the rock.	蟹図［表］ 牡丹図［裏］大衝立 Title: Crabs and Peonies Artist: Itō Jakuchū 伊藤若冲 (Japanese, 1716–1800) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-18th century, before 1766 Culture: Japan Medium: Double-sided freestanding screen (tsuitate); ink and gold on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 51 3/4 × 55 1/8 in.

888663.jpg	Handscroll of Ten Homoerotic (Nanshoku) Scenes	Miyagawa Chōshun 宮川長春	Japanese	early 18th century	Although during the Edo period there was no taboo or stigma associated with male-male sexual liaisons, and many famous writers, artists and other celebrities were known to have same-sex lovers, there are very few surviving deluxe paintings capturing such scenes as found in this handscroll (figs. 1a–j). Erotica known as shunga, “spring pictures,” in the Japanese tradition was often presented in deluxe handscrolls as here, or in printed form, and was produced in great quantities through early modern times. Often a few scenes of male-male sex were integrated into handscrolls, albums or illustrated books devoted to erotica; to have an entire work dedicated to homoerotic liaisons, however, is rare.By definition, artists of the Ukiyo-e school portrayed images of courtesans or recognizable Kabuki actors. Nearly all of Chōshun’s surviving paintings—he did not design woodblock prints—capture images of beautiful women. This handscroll of male coupling is doubly remarkable. One of the few known paintings by Chōshun depicting a male figure is a hanging scroll of a wakashu (male youth), from the collection of the Tokyo National Museum (fig. 2). That iconic depiction overlaps in details with several of the figures of young men depicted here, notably, the young men’s distinctive hairstyle: forelocks and a shaven pate beneath an extra-long topknot. The wakashu in the Tokyo painting also sports an elegant haori, or thigh-length jacket, trousers, and swords tucked into his sash—attire also seen in the standing figure in the last scene of this handscroll. All ten scenes of this handscroll by convention depict scenes of lovemaking between an older man and one or a pair of younger men dressed or partly dressed in flamboyant costumes. Some appear to be scions of samurai families (who wield swords), others—wearing brightly colored kimonos more appropriate for young women—are young Kabuki actors who played female roles on the stage, still others were wakashu escorts for older men who frequented the pleasure quarters. One scene includes a female voyeur peeking at the amorous activities from behind a screen. The final five scenes are more explicit than the preceding five, and several show the lovers posed with accoutrements such as a shamisen (three-stringed musical instrument), and a tray of smoking utensils. As was the case of heterosexual erotica of the Edo period, there is often a dimension of playfulness—or sarcasm—to representation of lovemaking, keeping in mind that another term for pornography of the Edo period was warai-e, or “pictures to laugh about.”Despite the nonchalant societal acceptance of male-male coupling as a completely natural behavior by men at the time, painted images of same-sex erotic encounters are quite rare, though we can be sure that part of the issue is that in modern times many have been destroyed. Images of lesbian sex from the Edo period seem not to survive. The works of male erotica that do survive, as here, mostly date to the early eighteenth century and show scenes of a mature patron who is the active partner with the youth in the passive role. Oral sex is rarely depicted, and kissing infrequent, though this scroll unusually has two instances. These conventions hold true for later woodblock-printed male-sex manuals such as Male Love: Actors Without their Make-Up (Nanshoku hana no sugao) from the later eighteenth century, where again “... the older man invariably [takes] the active role in all sexual encounters and the younger man the passive role." (Timothy Clark, Shunga: Sex and Pleasure in Japanese Art, London, British Museum, 2013, pp. 20–21 and 443).Most erotica by Ukiyo-e school artists is created anonymously or signed with a nom de plume, so it is unusual in this case to find the handscroll signed by the artist. But rather than using his usual surname Miyagawa (taken from the name of his birthplace), the artist styles himself Hishikawa Chōshun, indicating that he saw himself as the stylistic heir of the pioneering Ukiyo-e artist Hishikawa Moronobu (1618–1694), even though Chōshun was too young to have actually studied with him. Indeed, in this work we see the late Moronobu style integrated into the softer, more voluptuous mood of the early eighteenth century, of which Chōshun was an proponent. This early work from Chōshun’s corpus, with brilliantly detailed kimono, also attests to his reputation as one of the great colorists of the Ukiyo-e tradition.Each of the scenes of male-male lovemaking is a bit salacious, some more than others, and conveys various emotional states of mind:Scene 1The opening scene shows a recumbent wakashu (male youth), a sword tucked into his sash, gently pressing against an older man who leans on a decorated lacquer armrest. The young man affectionately grasps the wrist of his mature companion.Scene 2A young man in a gorgeous green robe with oversize floral motif seems taken aback by the advances of an older townsman. On the right a wakashu entertainer strums a shamisen (the three-string instrument popular in Kabuki and among male and female entertainers of the pleasure quarters), seemingly oblivious of the mischief taking place nearby.Scene 3A wakashu plucks the whiskers of an older patron as he sleeps. The pale brown robes perhaps indicate he is a Buddhist monk since, monks were known to hide their shaven heads by wearing maruzukin, or rounded cloth caps, worn by doctors or elderly men, when they visited the pleasure quarters. A boy attendant with a smoking set in front of him looks on.Scene 4A young man kisses his older patron, scattering the game pieces of an interrupted game of go. This scene is unusual in that the amorous advance is being made by the wakashu.Scene 5As the older patron penetrates him from behind, the wakashu seems bored or exasperated by the entire enterprise.Scene 6A young man, still in his fundoshi loincloth mounts the older man. They frolic atop a rolled-up yogi¸ referring to the large quilted kimono used as bedding.Scene 7A threesome of nearly completely naked men is seated beside a desk with a calligraphy set and a sheaf of paper. The young man with the red fundoshi sits on the lap of the older man, while the other young man embraces the older man from behind.Scene 8In contrast to the design of the exultant phoenix embroidered on the yogi quilt, the two lovers, one older, the other much younger, seem almost bored by their frolicking, as the older man tries to penetrate from behind.Scene 9An older woman peers at the male lovers from behind a folding screen painted with ink bamboo. They kiss as the older man with a red fundoshi penetrates the young man, still garbed in a green robe decorated with chrysanthemums, a motif associated with the Chinese legend of the Chrysanthemum Boy, the youthful paramour of an emperor. The screen is signed by the artist, “Hishikawa Chōshun hitsu” (painted by Hishikawa Chōshun), borrowing the family name and indicating his indebtedness to Hishikawa Moronobu, the pioneering painter and printmaker of the Ukiyo-e school.Scene 10. This final scene shows an older samurai and his wakashu companion in flagrante delicto being interrupted by another, fully dressed young man who has a sword tucked into his sash. The yogi, or oversize quiltlike garment that covers them, is gorgeously decorated with motifs of chrysanthemum flowers and tie-dyed leaves.	男色秘戯図巻 Title: Handscroll of Ten Homoerotic (Nanshoku) Scenes Artist: Miyagawa Chōshun 宮川長春 (Japanese, 1683–1753) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; ink and colors on silk Dimensions: Image: 10 11/16 in. × 11 ft. 1 7/8 in.

853201.jpg	Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang	Iwasa Matabei (Iwasa Matabē) 岩佐又兵衛	Japanese	ca. 1640s	This diptych of atmospheric ink landscapes does not feature calligraphic inscriptions but is replete with poetic suggestiveness. Though both left and right scrolls appear to be coherent independent compositions, they work together to incorporate visual references to the theme of the Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers, inspired by verses of the poet Song Di (ca. 1015–ca. 1080) about the region around the confluence of the two rivers in the present-day Hunan province. In this rendition, traditional motifs from the eight views have been innovatively compressed into a diptych format.The Eight Views pictorial theme became popular in the late eleventh century in China and was transmitted to Japan in medieval times via imported Chinese paintings. Here, in the right scroll, four of the eight views referred may be discerned (from the top to the bottom of the composition) as “Autumn Moon over Lake Dongting” (洞庭秋月); “Evening Bell from a Mist-Shrouded Temple” (煙寺晩鐘), “Mountain Market in Clearing Mist” (山市晴嵐)’ and “Fishing Village in Evening Glow” (漁村夕照)—the latter suggested by an array of fishnets and a lonely fisherman. In the left scroll, the remaining four views are represented, once again from top to bottom: “River and Sky in Evening Snow” (江天暮雪)—evoked by the snow covered trees on steep mountains; “Wild Geese Descending to a Sandbar” (平沙落雁)—formations of geese are visible to the far right of the scroll; “Sails Returning from a Distant Shore” (遠浦帰帆); and “Night Rain on the Xiao and Xiang Rivers” (瀟湘夜雨)—subtly alluded to by a man with an umbrella with a cloud of dark mist above.Aside from this diptych, very few landscape paintings by Matabei are known to survive: a pair of screens of rural occupations in the four seasons; a handscroll on the theme of the Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang (both in the Idemitsu Museum of Arts); another impromptu painting of a misty mountain scene (whereabouts unknown). The meticulously detailed Eight Views handscroll, with poetic inscriptions by Chinese émigré scholar and poet Chen Yuanyun (Chin Genpin 陳元贇, 1587–1674), lacks the painter’s signature or seal, but the idiosyncratic handling of trees and other landscape elements (the spindly needles of the pines and the pointillist depiction of foliage) in the handscroll and the diptych point to Matabei’s authorship of both. A small round painting showing a Chinese gentleman having his ears cleaned by a younger male servant in the Fukui Fine Arts Museum also has a pine tree rendered in the same style as here and features the same square “Dōun” relief seal.The brushwork in the diptych is completely different from that in Matabei’s paintings illustrating classical Japanese narratives (MMA acc. no. 2019.218), or his portraits of poets (MMA acc. nos. 1975.268.124; 2021.398.15). His earlier works demonstrated how he was able, within the compass of a diminutive composition, to capture intense emotion and the grand pathos of episodes from classical literature; and he imbued works with a psychological penetration previously unseen in the history of Japanese painting. Yet these ink landscapes from his final years show how he reverted to his Kano school roots and developed a renewed interest in Chinese themes such as the Eight Views. In contrast to the traditional Kano styles, however, the use of strong outline strokes is avoided for the most part and instead soft ink washes and reserved passages are used to connote the shapes of the moon, or mist- and snow-covered mountains. The ultimate effect is to convey a dreamlike quality that evokes nostalgia for the famous scenes articulated in medieval Chinese poems without any reference to the political symbolism inherent in some versions (see Murck 1998). The result is a harmoniously complementary pair of landscape paintings.	岩佐又兵衛筆 瀟湘八景図 Title: Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang Artist: Iwasa Matabei (Iwasa Matabē) 岩佐又兵衛 (Japanese, 1578–1650) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1640s Culture: Japan Medium: Diptych of hanging scrolls; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 36 3/8 × 11 3/8 in.

The white kerchief covering the dancer’s hair, however, suggests that this is actually a male youth (wakashu) cross-dressed as a stylish woman. This was a common practice, especially on the Kabuki stage after 1629, when female actors were banned because it was thought that they were using theatrical performances as fronts for prostitution. Here, the wakashu dancer holds a golden folding fan, decorated with the red orb of the sun rising through suzuki grass.	舞妓図 若衆図 Title: Wakashu (Male Youth) Dancer with a Fan Artist: Unidentified Artist Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1670–80 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 33 1/16 × 10 7/8 in.

The flowing robes are outlined with a large brush, demonstrating calligraphic bravura. For the hair, Buson’s use of a dry and forked brush over wet ink washes creates a tousled, rough quality that captures the hermits’ untamed nature.	与謝蕪村筆 寒山拾得図 Title: Hanshan and Shide Artist: Yosa Buson (Japanese, 1716–1783) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 1770s Culture: Japan Medium: Diptych of hanging scrolls; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 55 × 23 3/16 in.

He is on a quest for the herb of immortality.The eldest son of an affluent family of mint officials in Kyoto, Go Shun began his career as a painter and haiku poet under the guidance of the renowned practitioner Yosa Buson (1716–1783)—whose stylistic influence is particularly evident in this example. Go Shun emerged as a prominent artist in his own right, founding the influential Shijō school in Kyoto. When writing Japanese poetry or painting Japanese-style compositions, he worked under the name Matsumura Gekkei.	呉春(松村月渓)筆 渓山探薬図 Title: Herb Gatherer in the Mountains Artist: Go Shun (Matsumura Gekkei) (Japanese, 1752–1811) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. after 1780 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 44 1/8 × 16 1/8 in.

853212.jpg	Viewing a Waterfall	Kushiro Unsen 釧雲泉	Japanese	1793	A scholar in a white robe standing next to an aged pine tree on a rugged mountain ridge contemplates a distant waterfall. A scholar gazing upon a waterfall is an age-old painting theme throughout East Asia, which first emerged in Song dynasty painting. The Late Edo literati artist Unsen presents this conventional motif in a rustic setting, presumably inspired by the impressive brushstrokes of the Yuan-dynasty literati painters. Through his rapid, repetitive and sometimes eccentric brushwork, the scholar is framed in a precipitous gorge.An original couplet of Chinese verse by the artist is inscribed along with his signature above the pine tree. It reads:飛瀑銜秋氣 / 垂藤引夏涼A soaring waterfallharnesses the autumn air;Dangling vinespull in coolness to summer.(Translated by Tim Zhang)According to his signature, Unsen painted this work while based in Bitchū province (present-day Okayama prefecture) as a guest of a local official. At a young age, Unsen studied painting and Chinese with Chinese merchants visiting the port city of Nagasaki. Later he traveled around Japan, establishing friendships with many famous intellectuals. He became known for his expressive landscapes inspired by Chinese literati pain	釧雲泉筆 觀瀑山水図 Title: Viewing a Waterfall Artist: Kushiro Unsen 釧雲泉 (Japanese, 1759–1811) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1793 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 50 13/16 × 21 7/8 in.

872015.jpg	Shakyamuni Emerging from the Mountains, with Dragon and Tiger	Kano Sansetsu	Japanese	second quarter 17th century	This triptych of scrolls centers on a pivotal moment in the historical Buddha’s personal spiritual development, as he emerges from the wilderness after an extended period of ascetic practice. Emaciated, with an unkempt beard, he is supported by two powerful beasts of heaven and earth commonly seen in Zen Buddhist pictures and spaces. At right a dragon bursts forth from a swirl of murky clouds, while at left a tiger tiptoes out of the shadows of a grove. Kano Sansetsu, a leading painter in Kyoto in the 1630s and 1640s and a central figure in Japan’s most prominent painting school, was devoted to the study of classical Chinese and Japanese pictures. While he was not a monk, his art draws on older Chinese and Japanese Zen images that were familiar to his sophisticated Kyoto audience of Zen priests and their wealthy patrons.	狩野山雪筆 出山釈迦・竜虎図 Title: Shakyamuni Emerging from the Mountains, with Dragon and Tiger Artist: Kano Sansetsu (Japanese, 1590–1651) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: second quarter 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Triptych of hanging scrolls; ink on paper Dimensions: Image (a): 41 3/4 × 15 3/8 in.

Tucked into his sash is a pair of swords, not weapons but accessories. The product of a culture in which male-male sexual liaisons were not stigmatized, images of wakashu would have been acquired and cherished by wealthy patrons of the demimonde.	若衆立姿図 Title: Wakashu (Male Youth) with Two Swords Artist: Unidentified artist Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll: ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 25 15/16 × 9 15/16 in.

897120.jpg	The Tale of Genji	Iwasa school		late 17th–early 18th century	This pair of screens captures a dozen episodes from The Tale of Genji, written in the early eleventh century by Murasaki Shikibu, a lady-in-waiting and poet at the imperial palace. As pointed out elsewhere in this gallery, Genji details the life, loves, and political intrigue of the radiant Genji, a nobleman at the Heian court. Each panel here illustrates a famous scene from the story.Although Genji was a frequent subject for Tosa school painters, a close examination of the facial expressions and attire in this example reveals something radically different, pleasantly unorthodox, and vibrantly colorful. These paintings embrace a style associated with Iwasa Matabei (1578–1650), renowned for his depictions of classical literature, and were created within a generation or two of his death.	岩佐派筆 源氏物語図屏風 Title: The Tale of Genji Artist: Iwasa school Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 17th–early 18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel screens: ink and color on paper Dimensions: Each: Image: 50 3/8 × 20 3/8 in.

Above, Taiga’s mentor, Yanagisawa Kien, transcribed a poem about an autumn scene by the Chan monk Quanshi Zongle (1318–1390). Kien’s cursive calligraphy—with its thin, elegantly curving strokes—resembles that of Dong Qichang (1555–1636).四山一片秋色 野客獨坐茅亭渡頭紅葉如雨 石上長松自青The mountains in four directionsare awash with autumn colors,As a recluse sits alonein the thatched pavilion.At the ferry crossing,crimson leaves fall like rain,Atop the rocks,the tall pines remain green.—Trans.

897122.jpg	Dragon and Tiger	Maruyama Ōkyo	Japanese	1770	Auspicious images of dragons and tigers stand out as among the most popular Chinese pictorial themes transplanted to Japan. The East Asian dragon, usually represented surrounded by clouds, is associated with water, embodying a dynamic natural force manifest in thunderstorms. The dragon is said to preside over the heavens, while the tiger, an animal not native to Japan, is believed to rule the earth. In the right-hand scroll of this entirely monochrome composition, Maruyama Ōkyo depicts the dragon emerging from clouds rendered in the layers of soft washes for which the artist was famous. At left, the tiger—its fur meticulously picked out in fine brushstrokes—glares upward at the dragon but displays little suggestion of ferocity, as is typical of Japanese depictions.	円山応挙筆 龍虎図 Title: Dragon and Tiger Artist: Maruyama Ōkyo (Japanese, 1733–1795) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1770 Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls: ink on silk (dragon), ink and color on silk (tiger) Dimensions: Image (dragon): 41 13/16 × 19 11/16 in.

897127.jpg	Hokku on “New Year’s Crow,” with a Painting of a Courtier	Inscription by Yosa Buson	Japanese	ca. mid-1780s	After the death of the poet-painter Yosa Buson, his pupil Matsumura Gekkei (who used the alias Go Shun when creating Chinese-style paintings) was asked to authenticate surviving examples of his master’s handwriting. On the narrow slip of paper placed at the far right of this scroll, Buson had inscribed a hokku (seventeen-syllable poem) alluding to the tradition of welcoming the crow’s first caw as a harbinger of spring and the New Year. At left, Gekkei added a playful portrait of Tachibana no Suemichi, a poet from the Heian period (794–1185) whom Buson had often depicted after having a peculiar New Year’s dream about him. The hokku reads: 己か羽の 文字もよめたり 初烏I, too, can read the characters on the feathers of the year’s first black crow.	与謝蕪村筆 「初烏」句 松村月渓(呉春)筆 老翁図 Title: Hokku on “New Year’s Crow,” with a Painting of a Courtier Artist: Inscription by Yosa Buson (Japanese, 1716–1783) Artist: Colophon by Matsumura Goshun (Japanese, 1752–1811) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. mid-1780s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll: ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 7 9/16 × 13 1/8 in.

45631.jpg	Mandala of the Sannō Shrine Deities		Japan	17th century	This mandala gives concrete visual expression to the Japanese Buddhist concept of “original ground and flowing traces” (honji-suijaku) in which Japanese deities, known as kami, are considered to be manifestations (“flowing traces”) of Buddhist deities (“original ground”). The concept satisfied the desire of early medieval Japanese Buddhists to reconcile preexisting kami worship with the Buddhist tradition. Here, in an early premodern iteration of the theme, the seven kami of the Upper Sannō shrines are depicted in their original Buddhist forms along with three kami from the Middle Sannō shrines along the bottom. The Sannō (literally, "mountain king") shrine complex is situated in the eastern foothills of Mt. Hiei, northeast of Kyoto, overlooking Lake Biwa. The name refers to the tutelary kami of the Enryakuji Temple on Mt. Hiei, where Saichō (767–822), founder of the Tendai School of Buddhism, established his headquarters.	山王本地仏曼荼羅 Title: Mandala of the Sannō Shrine Deities Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 17th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, and gold on silk Dimensions: 42 1/4 x 16 7/8 in.

54566.jpg	Peacocks, Pine Tree, and Peonies	Style of Lü Ji 呂紀	Chinese	probably 19th century	Paintings by Lü Ji (Japanese: Ryoki), a professional painter from the area of Ningbo in China, began to be exported to Japan by the early sixteenth century and had a significant impact on polychrome bird-and-flower painting in Japan during the late Muromachi period (1392–1573) and thereafter. This Lü Ji style work, created in Japan, bears a forged copy of a seal found on genuine works by Lü (see, for example, 1980.414 and 2005.494.2). It was likely created late in the Edo period or shortly thereafter, when largescale works by Lü or in his style continued to be in high demand. The painted image has been significantly compromised, with widespread abrasion of the surface and loss of pigments, which may have occurred when the work was remounted in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, before it was donated to The Met in 1914.	松牡丹孔雀図 Title: Peacocks, Pine Tree, and Peonies Artist: Style of Lü Ji 呂紀 (Chinese, active late 15th century) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) or Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: probably 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 61 1/2 × 31 3/8 in.

Cheated out of the first rank in civil service examinations, he died by suicide but was buried with honors after the emperor heard of his tragic death. In gratitude, Shōki appeared to a subsequent Chinese emperor in a dream as an exorcist who vowed to quell demons and banish disease.In Japan, auspicious images of Shōki were displayed for Boys’ Day, a spring festival celebrating children’s health. In this work made by Katsushika Hokusai at the age of eighty-seven, the artist painted Zhong Kui in red, a color thought to have magical efficacy in warding off smallpox.	葛飾北斎筆 朱鐘馗図 Title: Red Zhong Kui, the Demon Queller Artist: Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1846 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 23 1/4 × 11 7/8 in.

Bunchō learned various Chinese painting styles when in the service of Matsudaira Sadanobu (1758–1829). Bunchō borrowed the pictorial vocabulary of birds and flowers from such painters as Sō Shiseki (1712–1786), who had studied the Chinese treatment of these subjects in Nagasaki.	牡丹に孔雀図 Title: Peacocks and Peonies Artist: Tani Bunchō (Japanese, 1763–1840) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1820 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 60 1/4 × 34 3/4 in.

45816.jpg	Gamecocks	Katsushika Hokusai	Japanese	dated 1838	The bantam cock on the right aggressively faces off with his companion to the left as it eyes us, the viewers, as if to ask whether it should engage in battle. In the trademark fashion of Hokusai animal paintings, the expressions of the birds convey humanlike emotions. Their plumage is meticulously rendered, suggesting adeluxe commission. From ancient times in Japan, gamecocks (Japanese: shamo) were specifically bred as fighting birds. There has long been debate among specialists over the authorship of this painting, due in part to the overly elaborate signature on the painting, the likes of which has been seen on no other work associated with the artist. The artist’s age is given as seventy-nine, and the work is dated to the sixth month of 1838, which is an entirely plausible date of execution. The signature reads “Saki no Hokusai Gakyō Rōjin (Formerly Hokusai, the Old Man Mad about Painting), Nakajima Gozaemon Fujiwara Iitsu.” Though Nakajima was Katsushika Hokusai’s actual (adoptive) family name, Gozaemon was not among given names used by the artist. The variant of the Katsushika seal seen here, however, matches that found on other accepted paintings and suggests the work was created in the context of Hokusai and his studio. Whatever the circumstances of its production, this is a masterpiece of avian painting created in the distinctive style of Hokusai.	軍鶏図 Title: Gamecocks Artist: Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: dated 1838 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 21 3/4 × 33 7/16 in.

The episode of the book represented here relates the story of the master carpenter Suminawa of Hida, who created a carved bird so lifelike that another bird mistook it for a real one.

45526.jpg	Buffalo and Herdsman	Kawanabe Kyōsai 河鍋暁斎	Japanese	ca. 1887	One of the most engaging of Zen (Ch'an) Buddhist instructional tales is the "Ten Scenes with an Ox" (Jugyuzu), a Southern Song invention. The story of an ox-herding boy in search of his lost charge is an analogy for discipline and enlightenment as the wayward ox, standing for the self, is found, roped, and led home. Appealing as genre scenes, the fifth scene, of the ox being led by the boy (religious training), and the sixth scene, of the boy riding the ox toward home (the two as one), are often repeated apart from the set.Kawanabe Kyosai trained in the Kano studios and was well acquainted with popular Chinese themes in Japanese painting. His eccentric point of view makes even the most academic and conventionally executed of his works compelling.

54604.jpg	Eagle Attacking a Monkey	Kawanabe Kyōsai 河鍋暁斎	Japanese	1885	In this set of four large paintings (14.76.64a–d), depicting the fierce spirit of eagles hunting or protecting their young, the artist Kyōsai distilled the soul of the Japanese nation, which was at the onset of westernization and exerting itself as an international power. In addition to their regal presence, these raptors represented unhesitating, even ruthless action, a necessary quality during this turbulent period. Determined to break the mold of traditional East Asian ink painting, Kyōsai exaggerated the vigor of his subjects with coarse bravado, varying long and short brushstrokes and contrasts of light and dark. Kyōsai sought a degree of realism, even brutal naturalism, that indicates his final abandonment of the classical Kano-school aesthetic.Often called the last spark of the Kano school, Kyōsai was one of the first Japanese artists to be introduced to the Western world. A prodigy who started painting at age seven, the prolific Kyōsai built his art on the foundation of his early training in ukiyo-e and Kano-school painting techniques; later, he assimilated into his work such antithetical styles as Rinpa and Maruyama-Shijō realism.	猿を襲う鷲図 Title: Eagle Attacking a Monkey Artist: Kawanabe Kyōsai 河鍋暁斎 (Japanese, 1831–1889) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: 1885 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 65 1/2 × 32 7/8 in.

54605.jpg	Eagle Attacking a Mountain Lion	Kawanabe Kyōsai 河鍋暁斎	Japanese	1885	In this set of four large paintings (14.76.64a–d), depicting the fierce spirit of eagles hunting or protecting their young, the artist Kyōsai distilled the soul of the Japanese nation, which was at the onset of westernization and exerting itself as an international power. In addition to their regal presence, these raptors represented unhesitating, even ruthless action, a necessary quality during this turbulent period. Determined to break the mold of traditional East Asian ink painting, Kyōsai exaggerated the vigor of his subjects with coarse bravado, varying long and short brushstrokes and contrasts of light and dark. Kyōsai sought a degree of realism, even brutal naturalism, that indicates his final abandonment of the classical Kano-school aesthetic.Often called the last spark of the Kano school, Kyōsai was one of the first Japanese artists to be introduced to the Western world. A prodigy who started painting at age seven, the prolific Kyōsai built his art on the foundation of his early training in ukiyo-e and Kano-school painting techniques; later, he assimilated into his work such antithetical styles as Rinpa and Maruyama-Shijō realism.

54978.jpg	The Hell Courtesan	Seikei	Japanese	late 19th century	Perhaps reflective of the unstable political climate, the Hell Courtesan (Jigoku Dayū) was popularly depicted in woodblock prints and paintings especially during the transitional years between the Edo and Meiji periods. Centrally located on the back of the high-ranking courtesan’s robe is Emma-Ō, one of the Ten Kings of Hell, getting ready to sentence a sinner. He is surrounded by horned demons, strategically depicted along the garment folds, whose job it is to carry out punishments. By contrast, the obi shows a bodhisattva with attendants, who are descending from the heaven as saviors for the deceased.No biographical information about this artist or other works with the same signature have come to light. A nearly identical painting by Haruki Nanmei (1795–1878), dated to 1865 and in a private Japanese collection, was no doubt the inspiration for this later work.	地獄太夫図 Title: The Hell Courtesan Artist: Seikei (Japanese, active second half of the 19th century) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 39 1/8 × 20 1/8 in.

48882.jpg	Buddha’s Hand Citron (Busshukan)	Formerly attributed to Katsushika Hokusai	Japanese	mid-19th century	This meticulously rendered painting of an unusually shaped variety of citron, whose fruit is segmented into fingerlike sections, shows the influence of Western botanical studies. In Japanese, this exotic fruit is called busshukan 仏手柑, literally "Buddha’s Hand Citron." Native to the Himalayas, the subject was appreciated by Bunjin (literati) painters, and is the subject of a poem in Chinese “Koto and Buddha’s Hand in Springtime” by renowned historian, poet, and calligrapher Rai San’y (1780–1832).The painting does not seem to have any connection to Katsushika Hokusai except that it has a seal, rendered in cursive characters and kana that have been deciphered as Katsushika 葛しか. But since the shapes of the characters vary a bit from accepted variants, we can assume the seal was added a later time by a dealer who wanted give added luster to an anonymous painting.	仏手柑図 Title: Buddha’s Hand Citron (Busshukan) Artist: Formerly attributed to Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Matted painting; ink and color on silk Dimensions: 13 1/2 x 9 5/8 in.

He first studied Kano-style painting and then mastered the more naturalistic manner espoused by the Chinese painter Shen Nanpin (Shen Quan, 1682–1758) as well as by artists of the Maruyama-Shijō school. The more vigorous style he developed became a trademark of the Kishi school, of which he is considered the founder. This painting is signed with his alternative art name Dōkōkan 同功館.

48893.jpg	Woman Walking in the Snow	Utagawa Hiroshige	Japanese	1840s–early 1850s	In his prints, Hiroshige used the unprinted white paper to represent snow, a technique also exploited in this painting, in which unpainted silk, reserved against the pale ink wash, suggests the snow-covered areas. Slightly bleeding ink creates the impression of fluffy snow, and snowflakes were rendered with splashes of opaque white pigment. By contrast, the figure's partially revealed red undergarment intensifies the white.Hiroshige's early works, of the mid-to late 1820s, depict slouching, long-faced women, while his later works present tall beauties in landscape settings, as in this scroll, made in the 1840s or early 1850s.

42314.jpg	Female Entertainer with Shamisen	Teisai Hokuba	Japanese	early 19th century	A young woman with a shamisen and teacup sits on the second floor of a restaurant or brothel. A libretto rests on her lap. The river view beyond the balcony, showing customers making their way to the Yoshiwara pleasure quarters, presents a peaceful springtime scene dotted with cherry blossoms. The round box in front of the woman, used to hold tea utensils, is painted with a Chinese-style landscape. Teisai Hokuba, an early and close disciple of Katsushika Hokusai (1760–1849), emulated his master’s manner of depicting beautiful women, elongating their faces and describing their robes with kinetic brushstrokes. As here, he often rendered background landscapes in a sketchier, atmospheric style.	蹄斎北馬筆 三味線持つ美人図 Title: Female Entertainer with Shamisen Artist: Teisai Hokuba (Japanese, 1771–1844) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 31 1/8 x 11 1/4 in.

The composition is deftly framed, with the white roses arranged rhythmically from top to bottom. The one rose touching the water and fish form the focal point.Hōen was a student of Matsumura Keibun (1779–1843), and both artists emphasized further the decorative quality and refined descriptive method of their grand masters of the Maruyama-Shijō school, Maruyama Ōkyo (1733–1795) and his elder brother, Matsumura Goshun (1752-1811).

55378.jpg	Tanuki (Racoon Dog) Viewing Its Reflection in Water	Kawanabe Kyōsai 河鍋暁斎	Japanese	late 19th century	Although this image has traditionally been identified as a fox, which is a subject the artist frequently depicted, the shape of the animal’s face and the end of its tail indicates that was more likely meant to depict a tanuki, or Japanese raccoon dog. Both the fox and tanuki are celebrated in Japanese lore Caught in mid-leap as it gazes at a sketchily delineated and ambiguous form, the beast envisioned here recalls the tanuki’s fabled power to assume diverse transformations, frequently that of a beautiful woman, and to beguile the unwary.Kawanabe Kyōsai was one of the most prolific and original painters of the late Edo and early Meiji eras. His mastery of traditional painting techniques acquired by apprenticeship in the Kano school was transformed by strong personal eccentricity to gorge the lively original art exemplified here. The style and signature, "Seisei Kyōsai," indicate that this is a work of his final decade, the 1880s, when Kyōsai was at the height of his powers and was one of the earliest Japanese artists to be avidly admired and collected in Europe and the United States.

39725.jpg	Three Girls on a Riverbank	Torii Kiyonaga	Japanese	early 19th century	Three fashionably dressed women depicted in Kiyonaga's graceful, elongated style make their way along the banks of a river. While the primary focus is on the idealized beauties, landscape details augment the scene with lively notes of time and place. Reeds and willow branches rustle in the strong riverside breeze that lifts the women's robes, suggesting a fine day in early summer. In the distance, the bustling traffic of commercial craft and pleasure boats alike add to the buoyant mood and locate the scene on the river Sumida. Coursing through the downtown commercial districts in the eastern part of the capital of Edo, it was a major thoroughfare, connected to a network of canals and emptying into Tokyo Bay. While abbreviated seasonal motifs were conventional in ukiyo-e paintings, this work is notable for its interest in movement in both figures and landscape and for the details faithful to the scenery of 18th century Edo.

45229.jpg	Fox with Staff (Hakuzōsu)	Eiraku Hozen	Japanese	after 1848	A Kyoto potter with close ties to the literati in his city and a similar taste for Chinese styles, Hozen was known for his highly colored wares and for his use of gold. A different side of his urbanity comes through in this rather personal painting, perhaps tempered by the business failures he experienced in his later years. A few economic brush strokes create the figure of a fox-priest, the protagonist in the comic kyōgen play The Fox Trapper (Kirigitsune). The enigmatic poem cautions:Beware of those who have renounced the worldalthough they wear the robes of priestsat heart they are foxes still.

55295.jpg	Eaves Decorated with Irises for the Tango Festival	Kikuchi Yōsai	Japanese	dated 1867	Kikuchi Yōsai was a painter of distinguished samurai extraction who was most famous for his meticulously brushed portraits of historical personages. This abbreviated, probably impromptu, painting of a thatched roof decorated with irises was created to commemorate the Tango Festival, celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar year. The Tango Festival is also known as Boys’ Day, when families prayed for the health and strength of their male offspring (Girls’ Day is celebrated on the third day of the third month). Parents would put out samurai armor and warrior dolls in display alcoves and fly carp banners from the roof. According to folklore taking a bath with iris leaves on this day drives diseases away and eaves of homes were sometimes decorated with irises. The holiday is also called the Iris Festival (shōbu no sekku). The artist mentions in his signature this painting was created for this occasion.

Believed to reside on Mount Kunlun, a mythical paradise in the far west of China, she is a formidable deity in the ancient Daoist pantheon. In paintings, Xiwangmu is usually depicted with the image of a phoenix on her headdress, as in this work, and with an attendant holding a bowl of peaches, a symbol of longevity. The peaches in her orchard ripen every three thousand years. Osanobu, the last great master of the Kano school before the end of the Tokugawa regime, was also an antiquarian and copied ancient Chinese and Japanese paintings.	狩野養信筆 西王母図 Title: Queen Mother of the West Artist: Kano Osanobu (Japanese, 1796–1846) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: second quarter 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 39 3/4 × 14 7/8 in.

44941.jpg	Parody of the Four Accomplishments	Shibata Zeshin	Japanese	second half of the 19th century	This painting is inspired by one of the most celebrated works of Japanese genre painting: a work known as the Hikone Screen. Illustrated here are the “Four Accomplishments” necessary for well-cultivated gentlemen in ancient China—the musical instrument qin (Japanese: koto), the board game weiqi (Japanese: go), calligraphy, and painting. The Four Accomplishments were a favored painting subject beginning in the Muromachi period (1392–1573) but here appears as a parody—for instance, writing a love letter (or poems) instead of calligraphy. Zeshin’s reinterpretation, more than two centuries after the original, reconstructs some of the mysterious feel of the Hikone Screen by arranging meaningful-looking figures engaged in various pursuits within the same space. Nevertheless, the eye-pleasing impression has been attained by a careful compositional arrangement in which elements are ordered in a pyramid-like shape toward the center, and by the use of a variety of colors, from vivid to subtle, contrasting with the plain gold background. A few versions of this screen by Zeshin exist, each with distinct variations of the figures and setting.	見立琴碁書画屏風 Title: Parody of the Four Accomplishments Artist: Shibata Zeshin (Japanese, 1807–1891) Period: late Edo (1615–1868) or Meiji (1868–1912) period Date: second half of the 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink and color on gold leaf on paper Dimensions: each screen: 47 1/2 in. × 9 ft. 4 1/2 in.

48982.jpg	Morning Glories	Suzuki Kiitsu	Japanese	early 19th century	In this vivid display of rich blue and green against a gold-leaf background, Kiitsu concentrated on the proliferation of the blossoms and leaves by omitting any indication of space or context. The exuberant outburst is carefully orchestrated into two movements: the blossoms on the right rise up from the ground, while those on the left cascade down as if supported by an unseen trellis. Trained as a textile dyer, Kiitsu studied painting under Sakai Hōitsu (1761–1828), with whom he prepared an illustrated compendium of classic Rinpa art, One Hundred Paintings by Kōrin (Kōrin hyakuzu). Evident in these screens, especially in the brilliant decorative effects of thick mineral pigments on gold leaf, is the influence of both textile design and the Rinpa school.	朝顔図屏風 Title: Morning Glories Artist: Suzuki Kiitsu (Japanese, 1796–1858) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each screen): 70 3/16 x 12 ft. 5 1/2 in.

45382.jpg	Foreign Merchants in Japanese Trade Port		Japan	early 19th century	Things foreign enjoyed great popularity in sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century Japan, and a number of genre paintings in the screen format were devoted to the curiosity and artistic interest aroused by the presence of Portuguese and Spanish traders at port. The exotic costumes of Jesuit priests, Christian icons, strange animals, and oddities like clocks and guns all found their way into Japanese painting. These diminutive screens, created later in the Edo period, are a pastiche of earlier Nanban (“Southern Barbarian”) scenes, and shows the foreign traders who imported rare birds. They reprise the genre at a time when foreign presence in Japan was once again a major impact on Japanese culture after a long period of limited international relations.	異国人交易図屏風 Title: Foreign Merchants in Japanese Trade Port Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Six-panel folding screen; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 27 5/8 in. × 8 ft. 7 7/8 in.

45392.jpg	Persimmon Tree	Sakai Hōitsu	Japanese	1816	This painting, while exhibiting the trademark mottled-ink (tarashikomi) technique of the Rinpa school, reflects the artist’s interest in Western-style realism, which is combined with sophisticated, graceful forms. The intricately curling leaves of the tree and grass evoke the cold sky of the clear fall day alluded to in the inscription, which dates the screen to late autumn 1816.Hōitsu was born into a wealthy, influential samurai family and had all the advantages of the finest education, including the opportunity to study many of the painting styles available to artists in Edo Japan. He became a monk in 1797 and adopted the priestly name Monsen Kishin, which appears in the seal and signature on this screen.	酒井抱一筆 柿図屏風 Title: Persimmon Tree Artist: Sakai Hōitsu (Japanese, 1761–1828) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1816 Culture: Japan Medium: Two-panel folding screen; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 56 9/16 × 56 5/8 in.

44854.jpg	Tale of a Strange Marriage (Konkai Zoshi)	Ukita Ikkei	Japanese	ca. 1858	Satirical paintings with animals standing in for humans have a long history in Japanese art. A special genre of such paintings involves foxes, which are believed to transform themselves into humans on moonlit nights. This somewhat eerie depiction of a fox wedding under an autumn moon expresses the artist’s biting criticism of the Tokugawa shogunate and its attempt to shore up its waning authority by marrying an imperial princess to the shogun. The artist, Ukita Ikkei, was an important member of opposition political circles and a major figure in the revival of yamato-e, a distinctively Japanese style of courtly painting. As such, he was familiar with yamato-e masterpieces preserved in Kyoto, skillfully interpreting this traditional Japanese idiom. Each of the five scenes is taken directly from a venerated Kamakura-period scroll, The Miracles of the Kasuga Shrine (1309). Replacing the elegantly posed courtiers of the original with demonic-seeming foxes, Ikkei suffuses the scenes with a lurid unnaturalness heightened by the richly painted colors, creating a vision of pure sacrilege. Ikkei was arrested in a roundup of anti-Tokugawa forces in 1858. He died shortly after being released from prison one year later, leaving this stunning work unfinished.

The colophon, which was based on a poem by Shen Zhou (1427–1509), a noted Ming Chinese painter, also indicates that the work was created during the visit of a close friend named Nankai and was intended for Kōhō, a monk-painter from Echigo (now Niigata Prefecture).Noro Kaiseki, a nanga artist who trained under Ike Taiga (1723–1776), worked in the southern province of Wakayama and published a collection of writings entitled Gadan (Chats on Paintings).

A rice merchant in Osaka known for his love of learning, Beisanjin was an amateur painter whose quick flashes of insight were deeply admired by both his contemporaries and later literati artists. The patterned brushwork and overall energy of the painting surface reveal his study of Yuan-dynasty artists—notably Huang Gongwang (1269–1354)—and their successors.

48997.jpg	Misty Dawn at the Seashore	Okada Hankō	Japanese	19th century	This gentle, unassuming picture depicts a seaside village at dawn as the mist gradually clears from the mountains and treetops. The lone scholar at the bottom of the composition seems to walk toward, not away from, the viewer, an anomaly in an otherwise tradition-bound painting that depicts a narrow gorge and a small port in a steeply rising vertical composition.Hankō, son and pupil of Okada Beisanjin, grew up within the literati circle gathered around his father. Earning their living as rice merchants, Hankō and his father could devote themselves to Confucian studies and, later in life, to the study of painting in the style of Chinese Ming and Qing masters.

This letter to a friend, written when the artist was forty-nine, offers a gift of flowers arranged in a Chinese style, a practice cultivated by Japanese literati. The amusing twist: the gift was not actual flowers but flower sketches, executed in a charmingly free manner that reflects the spontaneous, personal quality espoused by Nanga (literati) painters in emulation of Chinese scholar-artists.	岡田半江筆 花卉図巻 Title: Letter Enclosing Flowers Artist: Okada Hankō (Japanese, 1782–1846) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1831 Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 6 3/4 in. × 12 ft. 7 5/16 in.

49023.jpg	Mountain Stream on a Summer Day	Nakabayashi Chikutō	Japanese	first half of the19th century	Born in Nagoya, the son of a doctor, Nakabayashi Chikutō moved to Kyoto in 1803 with fellow artist and friend Yamamoto Baiitsu (1783–1856) to join the circle of the philosopher-artist-poet Rai San’yō (1780–1832). After studying Chinese literati theory and technique, he developed a personal style that incorporated elements derived from the work of Chinese scholar-artists. In his inscription following the title of this painting, he notes that he modeled the work after the paintings of the Yuan-dynasty Chinese master Gao Kegong (1248–1310). Here, within a solid, centralized composition Chikutō created a sense of drama using intricate details that form lively patterns of dashlike brushwork. During the final years of his career, Chikutō withdrew to a studio on the outskirts of Kyoto, where he led a reclusive existence.	中林竹洞筆 夏日山泉図 Title: Mountain Stream on a Summer Day Artist: Nakabayashi Chikutō (Japanese, 1776–1853) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: first half of the19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 69 1/2 x 34 in.

49024.jpg	Landscape with Waterfall	Nakabayashi Chikutō	Japanese	1841	Chikutō painted this large landscape in the spirit of the Plum Blossom Daoist, the name given to the acclaimed Yuan-dynasty literati painter Wu Zhen (1280–1354). Chikutō’s diligent study of Chinese literati theory and technique, as expressed in printed treatises and manuals on painting, is evident here, particularly in his masterful rendering of the rocks using a combination of long, unaccented brushstrokes in pale, dry ink and staccato accents. Together with the darker horizontals of the distant pines and foliage, such brushwork derives from the visual vocabulary associated with Wu Zhen. Chikutō stated in a letter that this work would be his last large-scale landscape painting. Because of his advanced age (he was sixty-five at the time), the artist felt he could no longer continue to execute such large works, though he could still answer requests for plum and bamboo paintings, which required less complex details.	観瀑山水図 Title: Landscape with Waterfall Artist: Nakabayashi Chikutō (Japanese, 1776–1853) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1841 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 61 15/16 x 34 3/16 in.

49026.jpg	Herons in the Snow	Nakabayashi Chikutō	Japanese	ca. 1840	The characteristic decorative quality of Chikutō's painting is amply evident here in the rhythmic arrangement of the herons, boldly framed by their snowy perch. The stark black-and-white contrasts and the repetitive patterns of horizontal washes that define the white forms of the birds and branches further contribute to an effect of graphic elegance. Chikutō, born a doctor's son in Nagoya, moved in 1815 to Kyoto, where he joined the circle of the nanga artist Rai Sanyō (1780–1832).

49027.jpg	Egrets, Peonies, and Willows	Yamamoto Baiitsu	Japanese	early 19th century	A pair of herons pause in shallow water beneath a drooping willow branch and tall stems of flowering plants, painted in the “boneless” manner, with limited ink outline and pale wash. Yamamoto Baiitsu mingled with Kyoto literati circles but also sought varied artistic influences in the work of Chinese painter Shen Nanpin (Shen Quan, 1682–1758), who worked in Japan from 1731 to 1733, and other Chinese artists known in Japan. He transformed what he learned into an idiosyncratic style characterized by a sensuous surface quality and serene clarity. Distinctive to his technique was an inclination to use ink in the same manner in which colors were customarily applied—not only for linear brushwork but also for soft washes. Skillfully combining ink wash with washes of color and well-defined, sinuous contours, he contributed a lyrical, intimate vision of nature to Literati (Nanga) painting.	山本梅逸筆 柳鷺図 Title: Egrets, Peonies, and Willows Artist: Yamamoto Baiitsu (Japanese, 1783–1856) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; color on silk Dimensions: Image: 57 1/2 × 28 1/4 in.

45379.jpg	Sketch for the Portrait of Tachihara Suiken	Watanabe Kazan	Japanese	19th century	Tachihara Suiken was the father of a close friend of Kazan's. The completed work is now lost, but several surviving sketches reveal that the artist rejected the concealment of physical defects in favor of a sympathetic realism. In this sketch, the only embellishments that refer to the subject's social status are his sword and the book tucked into his robe. His shriveled mouth and unshaven chin, adroitly captured by the Western technique of chiaroscuro—which Kazan had studied—enhance the impression of intense self-determination made by this eighty-one-year-old samurai.

49007.jpg	Red and White Peach Blossoms	Tsubaki Chinzan	Japanese	1843	This pair of scrolls (with 1975.268.116) provides a unique insight into the studio process of a painter working in the later phase of the Nanga tradition. The scroll on the right is a shita-e, or preparatory sketch, for the completed work on the left. Tsubaki Chinzan constructed the composition using a collage method: the branches on the upper left, for example, appear to have been painted on a separate sheet, which the artist then pasted into the preliminary version. Chinzan then copied this composition onto the final scroll, using lighter brushstrokes and deleting all pentimenti. Unfortunately, Chinzan lost some of the verve of the study’s spiky draftsmanship when he made the transfer to the final work.	椿椿山筆 紅白桃花図（付・画稿） Title: Red and White Peach Blossoms Artist: Tsubaki Chinzan (Japanese, 1801–1854) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1843 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; color on paper Dimensions: Image: 55 1/2 x 14 5/8 in.

49010.jpg	Small Birds on a Willow Branch and Hibiscus Blossoms	Tsubaki Chinzan	Japanese	dated Fall 1850	Chinzan was raised in Edo in a samurai family. He trained under the Nanga painters Tani Bunchō (1763–1840) and Watanabe Kazan (1793–1841) and favored Chinese literati artists of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Specializing in paintings of birds and flowers, he was an avid participant in sencha tea ceremonies, during which he would enjoy viewings of Chinese paintings and antiquities owned by his associates. He enhanced this painting with a poem that alludes to a passage from the "Song of Everlasting Sorrow" by the Tang dynasty (618–906) poet Bai Juyi (772–846). In it, Chinzan imagines the moon shining on the face of Lake Taiye and wonders if someone, a person he does not directly identify, still dances in the heavens in the deep of night. As the crisp autumn air of the west wind awakens him from his musings, he finds he can still smell her fragrance on the dew. In the original poem, the emperor discovers that, after the tragic death of his beautiful love, Yang Guifei, the hibiscus by Lake Taiye reminds him of her face, while the willows at Weiyang Palace recall her eyebrows. In this way, the contemporary poem and painting are brought together by the ancient text.

49011.jpg	Small Bird on a Crepe Myrtle Branch	Tsubaki Chinzan	Japanese	19th century	At a time when the ukiyo-e tradition was emphasizing scenes of contemporary life in the urban world, nanga or "southern pictures," inspired by Chinese painting of the Ming and Qing dynasties, offered a retreat into the unhurried world of nature and art. Tsubaki Chinzan shows us a formal yet abbreviated landscape, where just two softly rendered boughs of the myrtle tree open their delicate foliage to embrace the rising moon, partially obscured by clouds. The evening mood invites contemplation and quietude, in an intimate moment shared with a tiny bird who is nestled securely among the spring foliage.

49012.jpg	Hawk Grasping a Small Bird	Tsubaki Chinzan	Japanese	19th century	Tsubaki Chinzan's versatility as a painter in the cultivated nanga style and as a portraitist of nature is underlined in this bold composition in which the absence of surrounding detail forces us to observe closely the hawk with its captured prey. Here is the world of flux—a natural order, where the supremacy of this proud hawk is determined by its swift wing, not unlike the prowess of the samurai, the class to which Chinzan belonged. The hawk alights on the sharply defined bamboo fronds, whose energized lines echo the shape of the bird's talons. The sharpness of the hawk's eye and the grasping motion of the protruding bamboo leaves above its head fracture the empty space in which the viewer may contemplate the other bird's uncertain fate.

45808.jpg	Enjoying the Evening Cool under a Gourd Trellis	Utagawa Toyohiro	Japanese	early 19th century	Known for his creative and subtle depictions of world-weary beauties, Toyohiro here captures a moment in the lives of a couple enjoying a cool evening. Both look relaxed; the husband is about to sing, while his wife, fanning herself, appears to be asking for a sip of wine. Seemingly an exquisite example of pure genre painting, it actually manifests a deeply rooted Japanese tradition in which painting is intimately linked to poetry, in this case a popular verse by Kinoshita Chōshōshi (1569–1649):Under a trellis of evening gourd blossoms,A man in a shirt and a woman in a petticoat,Enjoy the cool of evening.	夕顔棚下納涼図 Title: Enjoying the Evening Cool under a Gourd Trellis Artist: Utagawa Toyohiro (Japanese, 1763–1828) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 33 1/4 x 11 in.

This scene of the Imado Bridge captures the usually busy gateway to the pleasure quarters at a quiet moment before evening falls and lingers amidst the humble man-made and natural beauty of the river scene. The restrained wash and simple brushstrokes are well suited to his subject.

Works by Qiu Ying, a professional painter active in Suzhou in the first half of the sixteenth century, were treasured in Japan and are likely to have been the inspiration for this painting. Tani Bunchō was a prolific artist and art historian who worked in many Chinese and Japanese styles. The painting is signed Bunchō and bears a large and seldom-found seal.

49001.jpg	Cherry Blossoms at Yoshino	Painted and inscribed by Rai San’yō 頼山陽	Japanese	19th century	One of Japan’s most famous landscapes, the mountains of Yoshino covered with pink and white clouds of flowering cherry trees, is given a novel treatment by the distinguished historian and calligrapher Rai Sanyō, who adapted the venerated Chinese ink landscape mode associated with the Yuan literati painter Huang Gongwang (1269–1354). The inscriptions above this workman-like rendition of a mountain landscape illuminate the personal and cultivated nature of this painting, which commemorates a visit he made to Yoshino in the spring of 1827 with his uncle Kyōhei and his mother, Baishi, both eminent Confucian scholars. Sanyō's inscription at the right expresses his joy in fulfilling his dream of viewing the blossoms but clouds as he muses on the failed attempt by the emperor Go-Daigo (1319–1338) to restore imperial rule, evoking his Yoshino court in exile, and a neglected grave deep in the mountains. At left, Baishi's inscription in feminine Japanese Kana script reflects her joy in seeing the blossoms once more in old age.

44865.jpg	Landscape after Li Bai's poem	After Ike no Taiga	Japanese	probably 19th century	Shifting time and distance are the subject of the well-known poem by the Tang poet Li Bo (701–762) that inspired and grace this landscape by Ike no Taiga: Early morning, we leave Baidi, surrounded by tinted clouds. Although Jiangling is a thousand li away, we arrive in a day. Gibbons calling from riverside cliffs fail to detain us. Our small boat has already passed ten thousand peaks. Visually echoing the idiosyncrasies of the natural forms, Taiga's fluid and eccentric writing accentuates the outlines of the mountains and rocks and adds a literary dimension to an essentially decorative work. This pair of panels is an excellent example of his mature style, in which planes of mountain peaks are interspersed with the unpainted forms of clouds, river, and waterfalls. Taiga's characteristic drollery delights those who savor details, such as the tiny figures and playful gibbons, done, like the vines entwining the trees, with his fingernails instead of a brush.Taiga signed his bold transcription of the poem as Sangaku (Three Peaks), a sobriquet he assumed in 1748, after a journey to the three famous mountains of Japan. This screen was originally a pair of sliding doors for a residence in Niwase, near Izumo in western Japan.

Each of the more than fifty insects on this scroll, many lifted lightheartedly from the pages of the Chinese Mustard Seed Garden Manual, are given life and movement through the most economical of painted means.

40006.jpg	The Poet Li Bo's Visit to Mount Emei	Shiokawa Bunrin	Japanese	1875	Watery ink and small gold flecks sprinkled among valleys and mist create a luminous night scene under a hazy moon. The gentleman riding in the boat on the right screen is the famous Chinese poet Li Bo (701–762), who was inspired by moonlit Mount Emei Sichuan to compose a poem. Four years later, he returned to the area and composed a longer poem. In Japan, the two poems became particularly famous. Shiokawa Bunrin’s training was in the realist school of Shijō, but he was also familiar with the aesthetics of other artistic circles, especially the literati painters. These screens demonstrate Bunrin’s knowledge of Western perspective, especially in his treatment of the valley stream.	塩川文麟筆 登峨眉山図屏風 Title: The Poet Li Bo's Visit to Mount Emei Artist: Shiokawa Bunrin (Japanese, 1808–1877) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: 1875 Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink and gold on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 59 5/8 in. x 11 ft. 6 5/8 in.

Winter is not shown.) The artist's signature, Isai, and two seals, kai and ka, are found on both sides.Isai was one of a large number of artists trained by Katsushika Hokusai (1760–1849), a nineteenth-century giant of printmaking and painting. It is generally recognized that many of the paintings traditionally attributed to this great master were actually executed by some of his pupils, such as Isai. Indeed, this painting reveals many of Hokusai's idiosyncrasies, such as the figure types, the manner of depicting foliage, and the clearly defined recession into space.

53707.jpg	Seven Gods of Good Fortune	Nagasawa Roshū	Japanese	1837	The Seven Gods of Good Fortune, principal icons of popular culture in the Edo period, were depicted by Nagasawa Roshū in an accessible and lively manner, as though partaking in a meal—replete with wine—together. Most of the deities are shown seated beside the attributes or animals commonly associated with them; for instance, Jurōjin leans against a deer, Fukurokuju has a scroll (in this instance, three scrolls), and Bishamonten holds a miniature pagoda. The long-tailed tortoise below the only female deity, Benzaiten, could belong to either Jurōjin or Fukurokuju. Although he never attained the stature of his father, Nagasawa Rosetsu (1754–1799), Roshū perpetuated his style of soft, impressionistic brushwork in emotionally compelling paintings on natural and figural subjects. The artist signed the painting “Roshū, Old Man of 71 Years” (Shichijū-ichi ō, Roshū), which is seventy years old by Western reckoning, so we know the work was executed in 1837.	長澤蘆洲筆 七福神図 Title: Seven Gods of Good Fortune Artist: Nagasawa Roshū (Japanese, 1767–1847) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1837 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: 34 7/8 x 14 1/8 in.

On the right screen, three Chinese gentlemen-scholars enjoy tea. The left screen features a sumptuous mansion with covered corridors; a pavilion stands atop stone masonry. Scholars sit within the pavilion, while the lady of the house and two maidservants can be seen in other parts of the building. More scholars approach the house on foot and by boat.The artist, Mori Shūhō, was the elder brother of the better-known Mori Sosen (1747–1821), a renowned painter of monkeys. Shūhō incorporated the orthodox Kano style of painting (evident in the linear brush technique) with newly learned Western elements like the low-lying foreground, which creates a strong sense of distance. Such divergent features forecast the complex developments that were to characterize artistic movements of the nineteenth century immediately following Shūhō’s death.	森周峰筆 楼閣山水図屏風 Title: Landscape with Pavilion Artist: Mori Shūhō (Japanese, 1738–1823) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, gold flecks, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each screen): 5 ft. 2 3/16 in. x 11 ft. 8 15/16 in.

This beauty's sumptuous, lavender-colored outer garment featuring three-dimensional wisteria blossoms is worn over layered robes, all rendered in extraordinary detail, including an elaborate obi decorated with a lion and peonies in gold. Her coiffeur boasts an assortment of tortoiseshell combs and long hair ornaments. Only the full moon, a pale orb rendered against faint washes of ink, and two geese in flight in the upper section of the scroll suggest an outdoor evening setting.

Flamboyant brushstrokes of coal-black ink define the hefty trunks and spiky needles, resulting in a sense of powerful monumentality. Together with his father, Suzuki Hyakunen, Shonen was one of the leading painters active in Kyoto during the Meiji period. After the country became more open to the West in the second half of the nineteenth century, they made efforts to preserve the subjects and style of traditional Japanese painting.	鈴木松年筆 老松図屏風 Title: Aged Pines Artist: Suzuki Shōnen (Japanese, 1849–1918) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: late 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink on gold-leaf Dimensions: Image (each): 68 1/16 in. x 12 ft. 1 3/16 in.

72722.jpg	Bamboo in Summer	Takahashi Sōhei	Japanese	1827	Takahashi Sōhei began studying painting with Tanomura Chikuden (1777–1835), a leading literati painter and fellow native of Bungo Province (modern-day Oita Prefecture) on the far western island of Kyūshū. Sōhei first encountered Chikuden in 1822 when the master visited Sōhei's hometown of Kitsuki from Kyoto. Soon thereafter, Sōhei took Chikuden as a teacher and returned with him to Kyoto, where he was quickly recognized as one of Chikuden's most promising students. Active thereafter primarily in Osaka, Sōhei was so highly regarded by Chikuden that in the master's Record of Painting Teachers and Friends of Chikuden-sō (Chikudensō shiyū garoku), he is the only of Chikuden's disciples listed alongside many senior, leading artists of the day. However, by his mid-twenties, Sōhei had contracted an illness that forced him to spend most of his time back home in Bungo. Although his age at death, thirty-two, is known, there is some confusion about the exact year. He is thought to have stayed in Bungo permanently after 1830, and rumors that he had died began circulating in 1833, but he is believed to have survived a couple more years, until around 1835.In this early work, completed only five years after his initial encounter with Chikuden, Sōhei depicted the vitality of young, growing bamboo, one of his favorite subjects. Sōhei’s painting technique contains within it a subtle contrast: each leaf and the trunk of the plant are meticulously outlined with smooth, thin brushstrokes in contrast to the delicate ink wash that defines the rock and the groundline.	高橋草坪筆 墨竹図 Title: Bamboo in Summer Artist: Takahashi Sōhei (Japanese, ca 1804.– ca. 1835) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1827 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 53 3/8 x 16 3/8 in.

75265.jpg	Portrait of Iwai Kumesaburō II	Utagawa Kunisada	Japanese	ca. 1827–29 (Kansei 10–12)	This portrait captures the appearance of Iwai Kumesaburō II (Hanshirō VI, 1799–1836), the famous player of female roles in Kabuki theater, as a young man in his late twenties. The actor is portrayed in formal clothing, not in costume. Covering his shaven pate is a purple square of silk, a symbol of status worn by players of female roles since the seventeenth century. One of Iwai's specialties was performing multiple roles at the same time, and it was during one of these performances, playing fifteen roles at once, that he became ill and died in 1836.Though the formal pose of the sitter calls to mind conventions used for memorial portraits, the handwriting style of the signature is one used by the artist in the late 1820s, about a decade before the actor died. Clearly the artist had left space for an inscription, perhaps one by the actor himself, but it was was never filled in.Utagawa Kunisada was one of the most prolific ukiyo-e print artists of the nineteenth century, but was also known for taking on deluxe painting commissions.	二代目岩井粂三郎の肖像 Title: Portrait of Iwai Kumesaburō II Artist: Utagawa Kunisada (Japanese, 1786–1864) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1827–29 (Kansei 10–12) Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll: ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 35 1/4 x 13 5/8 in.

The boys of summer try their skill at ferrying one another about in a small boat, while the winter squad braves uneven footing to shepherd an ever-larger snowball across a sparkling white field. Inspired by a Chinese painting tradition of depicting imperial children at play in palace gardens, this pair of screens subverts and updates the genre with its sparse, graphic landscapes.

The white color of the egrets was accomplished by cutting out the gold-leaf layer and exposing the paper, a technique the artist used on other examples of avian painting. Shibata Zeshin was predominantly known as a master lacquer craftsman, and also incorporated the technique into his paintings. Here, the lacquer employed in place of ink adds a rich, black sheen to the surface.

77202.jpg	Poppies	Suzuki Kiitsu	Japanese	mid-19th century	Not all flowers could be found in the colorful gardens cultivated by Rinpa artists through the ages. Yet poppies (keshi) clearly must have been a favorite of their clients, for examples survive from every generation of the school. Earlier, artists of the Sōtatsu studio, such as Kitagawa Sōsetsu (active mid-17th century), as well as Ogata Kōrin and his followers, took inspiration from screen paintings of poppies by Tosa artists, and took the formalization of leaves and petals one step further toward abstraction. By the age of Suzuki Kiitsu, however, attention to detail and a tendency toward naturalistic depictions of flowers became more pronounced. As seen here, the ink-mottling technique (tarashikomi) was used more liberally by later Rinpa artists.	鈴木其一筆 芥子図 Title: Poppies Artist: Suzuki Kiitsu (Japanese, 1796–1858) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 38 9/16 x 13 1/8 in.

675695.jpg	The Six Poetic Immortals	Kubo Shunman	Japanese	ca. 1810	This collaborative work by Shunman and a group of poets is an imaginary “group portrait” of the Rokkasen, or Six Poetic Immortals. These were Japanese court poets described as the leading poets of the early Heian period (794–1185) in the preface to the classical poetry anthology Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern (Kokin wakashū, ca. 905). Five men are seen gathered around Ono no Komachi, the sole woman in this venerable roster. This composition incorporates kyōka (witty thirty-one-syllable verse) by noted literati of early nineteenth-century Edo (present-day Tokyo): Shokusanjin (Ōta Nanpo, 1749–1823), Yadoya no Meshimori (1753–1830), Sakazuki no Komendo (active early nineteenth century), the artist-poet Shunman himself, and others. This type of painting was created spontaneously by poets composing verse at a public gathering.	窪俊満筆 六歌仙図 Title: The Six Poetic Immortals Artist: Kubo Shunman (Japanese, 1757–1820) , and others Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1810 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: 36 × 12 3/4 in.

670923.jpg	The Thirty-Six Poetic Immortals	Sakai Hōitsu	Japanese	1824	The Thirty-Six Poetic Immortals are famous poets, including five women, featured in an anthology compiled by Fujiwara no Kintō (966–1041) in the early eleventh century. Throughout medieval times these celebrated figures—whose periods of activity ranged from the seventh century to Kintō’s day—were often depicted in hand-scroll format. Imaginary portraits of the poets were accompanied by one or more of their most famous poems, generally the ones originally selected by Kintō. The painter and calligrapher Sakai Hōitsu notes in the colophon that this work was a tracing copy of a handscroll believed to have been illustrated and transcribed by celebrated medieval monk-poet Saigyō (1118–1190). Hōitsu did his best to emulate the precious poetry scroll, going so far as to mimic wormholes and other damage to the original.	酒井抱一筆 三十六歌仙図 Title: The Thirty-Six Poetic Immortals Artist: Sakai Hōitsu (Japanese, 1761–1828) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1824 Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Overall with mounting: 11 5/8 × 27 ft. 1 13/16 in.

53426.jpg	Cypresses	Ikeda Koson	Japanese	mid-19th century	In this dramatic close-up of a single landscape element, Ikeda Koson renders a timeless moment in a grove of hinoki cypresses. He depicts an atmosphere of misty space and shifting light by skillfully varying ink tones from black to gray in the leaves of frond-like branchlets. Texture and form result from the application of wet ink over pale washes on the tree trunks. Koson, a pupil of the Rinpa revivalist Sakai Hōitsu (1761–1828), brought a fresh vitality to standard themes in the Rinpa repertoire through his virtuoso brushwork and ability to convey naturalistic forms without sacrificing the bold decorative impact of his predecessors.

54773.jpg	Flowers and Birds of the Four Seasons	Ikeda Koson	Japanese	mid-19th century	The right-hand scroll depicts flowers of the spring and summer seasons; the left, flowers and foliage of autumn and winter. Both works are executed in subtle yet rich tones and soft washes of color; leaves, branches, and flowers are rendered in the “boneless” manner—devoid of outline—that was typical of established Rinpa style. In numerous areas pigments are pooled or puddled together to create a mottled effect, a technique known as tarashikomi. Among the more talented students of Sakai Hōitsu, Suzuki Kiitsu (1796–1858) is perhaps the most famous, but his younger contemporary Ikeda Koson was also an artist of great ability and dedication to the ideals of the Rinpa tradition. Koson was open to influences from other styles of painting, however; this pair of hanging scrolls owes much of its poetic appeal and its almost sensuous yet subdued colors to Koson’s Rinpa training.	池田孤邨筆 四季花鳥画 Title: Flowers and Birds of the Four Seasons Artist: Ikeda Koson (Japanese, 1803–1868) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image (a): 42 3/8 × 14 3/16 in.

53427.jpg	Six Jewel Rivers	Sakai Ōho	Japanese	ca. 1839	The titles of the six small-format handscrolls in this set refer to the six rivers in various parts of Japan that are named Tamagawa, or Jewel River. Each scroll shows a horizontal expanse of landscape in which the main elements of the composition are gradually introduced and then slowly fade out in almost cinematic fashion. The theme of six beautiful rivers enjoyed great popularity in the nineteenth century among both poets and ukiyo-e printmakers. Sakai Ōho, one of the last Rinpa artists of the Edo period, died when he was quite young, leaving only a small body of work. Many of his paintings are based on or inspired by the work of Sakai Hōitsu, his adoptive father and teacher.

670980.jpg	Hollyhocks and Prince’s-Feather Flowers	Sakai Ōho	Japanese	early 19th century	Many paintings by Sakai Ōho, including this one, are based on or directly inspired by the work of Sakai Hōitsu, his adoptive father and teacher. Hōitsu no doubt had great aspirations for Ōho, but he died in his early thirties and left a comparatively small body of work. Hollyhocks (tachiaoi)—with their stately appearance, tall stems, and symmetrical arrays of leaves and blossoms—were a common subject of Rinpa artists from the seventeenth century onward, but prince’s-feather flowers (katade) rarely received such attention. The addition of a little butterfly, flat and decorative in its effect, is a reminder that the artist was capturing a poetic moment, a haiku-like snapshot of an imaginary garden. This work was probably created as the right-hand scroll flanking the god of good fortune, Jurōjin, in a triptych.	酒井鶯浦筆 立葵とカタデ図 Title: Hollyhocks and Prince’s-Feather Flowers Artist: Sakai Ōho (Japanese, 1808–1841) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 40 1/2 in. × 14 in.

670930.jpg	Woman with Battledore and Shuttlecock	Torii Kiyotomo	Japanese	1815–20	A gorgeously arrayed woman with a battledore (hanaoki) tucked under her arm fiddles with a feather shuttlecock used in the New Year’s game of hanetsuki, similar to the Western game of badminton. The identity of the artist of this bold ukiyo-e painting requires further investigation. Though there was a print artist of the Torii school who used the art name Kiyotomo, who was active in the early eighteenth century and known for his kabuki actor compositions, this would appear to be a different artist. Since the coiffure, sartorial choices, and overall style more closely resembles those of later artists of the Torii school, such as Kiyomine (1786–1868), we can assume that this is one of the ukiyo-e artists who emerged in the generation after Torii Kiyonaga (1752–1815), renowned as one of the great portraitists of female beauty of the late Edo period.	鳥居清友筆 羽根突き美人図 Title: Woman with Battledore and Shuttlecock Artist: Torii Kiyotomo (Japanese, active early 19th century) Period: Momoyama period (1573–1615) Date: 1815–20 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color and gold on paper Dimensions: Image: 45 3/16 × 20 11/16 in.

670908.jpg	Three Gods of Good Fortune Visit the Yoshiwara; or “Scenes of Pleasure at the Height of Spring”	Chōbunsai Eishi	Japanese	early 19th century	Chōbunsai Eishi, an artist of samurai descent who also created prints, illustrated several handscrolls showing patrons traveling to the pleasure quarters of Yoshiwara. In this and other versions, the artist added a twist by transforming some of the visitors into three of the Gods of Good Fortune—Ebisu, Daikoku, and Fukurokuju—and showing them revelling with courtesans in the bordellos. The inspiration for this theme seems to derive from a comic essay “Record of the Hidden Village” (“Kakurezato no ki”), written by Ōta Nanpo in 1781. At the beginning of the scroll, in the section not shown, the Gods of Good Fortune travel by boat to the pleasure quarters in northeastern Edo (present-day Tokyo). They start at the foot of Yanagi Bridge, disembark at Sanyabori, walk along the Dike of Japan (Nihon Tsutsumi), and finally enter Yoshiwara.	鳥文斎栄之筆 三幅神吉原通い図巻 「全盛季春遊戯」 Title: Three Gods of Good Fortune Visit the Yoshiwara; or “Scenes of Pleasure at the Height of Spring” Artist: Chōbunsai Eishi (Japanese, 1756–1829) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Handscroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 13 1/8 in. × 29 ft. 2 9/16 in.

Men and women from different walks of life—a flower vendor, a bookseller with a stack of books, assorted pilgrims, a lion-dance performer, and a warrior—huddle under the roof. A restless child, untroubled by the rainstorm, hangs upside down from a beam. This painting is based on a pictorial theme made popular by Hanabusa Itchō (1652–1724), who rendered the scene to represent the summer season in various formats (including a screen in the Burke Collection). The style here adheres neither to Hokuba’s usual hypermeticulous depictions of women of the pleasure quarters nor to his landscapes inspired by Kano-school paintings, but perhaps was directly inspired by Itchō or one of his followers.	蹄斎北馬筆 雨宿り図 Title: Taking Shelter from the Rain Artist: Teisai Hokuba (Japanese, 1771–1844) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early to mid-19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 15 1/2 × 27 5/16 in.

Miyeko Murase and Shiyee LiuMuch of what we know about Kinkoku's life and career can be gleaned from his autobiography, the Kinkoku Dōjin go-ichidai ki. Born in Ōtsu, a town near Kyoto on the shores of Lake Biwa in Ōmi Province, Kinkoku became a Buddhist monk as a young man and in adulthood practiced extreme austerities as a follower of the syncretic Shugendō sect. Traveling widely and never tied to a single teacher, Kinkoku drew from a variety of sources for his painting but is most closely associated with the great Yosa Buson (1716–1783), whose influence is apparent throughout Kinkoku's body of work. Although he never actually studied directly with Buson, so close to Buson's style was Kinkoku's that he gained the nickname "Buson of Ōmi Province" (Ōmi Buson).The rightmost of the two seals Kinkoku affixed to this painting, which consists of nine Chinese characters that can be translated as, "At the age of fifty-five I devoted myself to learning" 吾五十有五而志於學, is a playful allusion to the first line of a passage in chapter 2 of the Analects, in which Confucius describes his lifelong process of self-cultivation: "At the age of fifteen, I devoted myself to learning. At thirty, I became established. At forty, I no longer doubted. At fifty, I was fully committed to the mandate of heaven. At sixty, nothing I heard upset me. At seventy, I followed by heart without breaking any rule."	富士山図 (Fuji-san zu) Title: Mount Fuji Artist: Yokoi Kinkoku 横井金谷 (Japanese, 1761–1832) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 31 1/2 × 59 1/8 in.

It visualized an idyllic lifestyle set in a reclusive garden, as described by Li Yu (1611–1680), a Chinese novelist who also published a famous painting manual.

671012.jpg	Snowy Landscape	Takahashi Sōhei	Japanese	1824	This work by the Nanga painter Takahashi Sōhei shows a solitary fisherman casting his pole near a snowy embankment lined with budding plum trees. The image is accompanied by a quatrain: The tattered bamboo hat is all covered with snow.In a lone boat is an old fisherman.Gazing at the empty woods at sunset,he seems tied down in the frozen stream.(translated by Miyeko Murase and Shi-yee Liu)According to Sōhei's signature, it was executed in 1824 at the residence of Tanomura Chikuden (1777–1835), a leading literati painter and fellow native of Bungo Province (modern-day Oita Prefecture) on the far western island of Kyūshū who was Sōhei's first painting teacher, making this an especially early work by the artist.Sōhei first encountered Chikuden in 1822 when the master visited Sōhei's hometown of Kitsuki from Kyoto. Soon thereafter, Sōhei took Chikuden as a teacher and returned with him to Kyoto, where he was quickly recognized as one of Chikuden's most promising students. This work was created shortly thereafter. Active primarily in Osaka after his initial training with Chikuden and other painters in his circle, Sōhei was so highly regarded that in the Chikuden's Record of Painting Teachers and Friends of Chikuden-sō (Chikudensō shiyū garoku), he is the only of Chikuden's disciples listed alongside many senior, leading artists of the day. However, by his mid-twenties, Sōhei had contracted an illness that forced him to spend most of his time back home in Bungo. Although his age at death, thirty-two, is known, there is some confusion about the exact year. He is thought to have stayed in Bungo permanently after 1830, and rumors that he had died began circulating in 1833, but he is believed to have survived a couple more years, until around 1835.	高橋草坪筆 雪中山水図 Title: Snowy Landscape Artist: Takahashi Sōhei (Japanese, ca 1804.– ca. 1835) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1824 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 53 15/16 × 19 5/16 in.

670889.jpg	Luring the Sun Goddess Amaterasu Out of a Cave with Music; Death of the Historical Buddha	Kōno Bairei	Japanese	late 19th century	Kōno Bairei juxtaposes two images at the heart of modern Japan’s most prominent belief systems, Shinto and Buddhism. At right is Amaterasu, the Shinto Sun Goddess who, after bringing total darkness to heaven and earth by shutting herself in a cave, has to be lured out by her own reflection to restore light and life to the world. At left is the Buddha’s final death, or parinirvana, depicted in gold paint on a dark black ground.Though Buddhism and Shinto (as well as other faiths) were in dialogue throughout the premodern history of Japan, in the 1870s, the newly reinstalled imperial government sought to clarify—and separate—them. Also, government efforts at modern nation-building led to the development of nationalized arts education. Kōno Bairei helped establish and taught at Japan’s first public university devoted to the study of art.	幸野楳嶺筆 「磐戸奏楽図·双林入滅図」 Title: Luring the Sun Goddess Amaterasu Out of a Cave with Music; Death of the Historical Buddha Artist: Kōno Bairei (Japanese, 1844–1895) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: late 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of hanging scrolls; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image (a): 27 15/16 × 10 5/8 in.

An apprentice courtesan serves tea while a high-ranking courtesan makes a grand entrance. A feast of sashimi and other delicacies sits nearby. Teisai Hokuba, one of the earliest and most talented pupils of Katsushika Hokusai (1760–1849), focused his efforts on surimono (privately commissioned woodblock prints), book illustration, and deluxe paintings of beauties like this one. His signature indicates that he was seventy years old when he painted it, near the end of his long career.	蹄斎北馬筆 五美人図 Title: Five Beauties Artist: Teisai Hokuba (Japanese, 1771–1844) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1840 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 15 3/8 × 20 3/4 in.

78139.jpg	Bush Warbler (Uguisu) in a Plum Tree	Sakai Hōitsu	Japanese	early 19th century	The bush warbler, symbolic of early spring in both literature and the visual arts, was often paired with plum blossoms in poetry and painting. Here, a delicately delineated warbler perches on a blossoming plum tree, the trunk and branches of which are mottled with green in the wet-on-wet painting technique called tarashikomi, a characteristic of the Rinpa school. The second son of the lord of Harima province, Hōitsu had all the advantages of a wealthy samurai family, including the opportunity to study many works of art and experiment with different painting styles. He became an admirer of the Rinpa master Ogata Kōrin (1658–1716) and dedicated himself to the revival of Kōrin’s art. His paintings subsequently reflected the Rinpa style with sophistication and elegance, as well as an aesthetic debt to Kōrin. Hōitsu also published woodblock-printed catalogues of Kōrin’s paintings and the work of Kōrin’s brother, Kenzan (1663–1743).	酒井抱一筆 鶯白梅図 Title: Bush Warbler (Uguisu) in a Plum Tree Artist: Sakai Hōitsu (Japanese, 1761–1828) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 38 5/8 × 14 1/8 in.

78055.jpg	“Tenmangū,” Sugawara no Michizane as Tenjin Traveling to China	Sengai Gibon	Japanese	early 19th century	This spontaneously sketched image of a Japanese courtier by the Rinzai Zen monk Sengai Gibon alludes to the famous story of Tenjin traveling to Tang-dynasty China. Tenjin is the name given to Heian-period statesman Sugawara Michizane (845–903) after he died in exile and was posthumously recognized as a Shinto deity. The three highly-cursive characters to the left of the figure read ““Tenmangū,” which is the name of shrines created in Tenjin’s honor. By extension, “Tenmangū” can also be used to refer to Tenjin or Michizane himself, as here. The plum was Michizane's favorite flower and he is often represented holding a branch of blossoming prunus. This theme was particularly popular with artists inspired by Zen Buddhism, for instance, see the version created by Konoe Nobutada (2015. 300.72).	「天満宮」 渡唐天神図 Title: “Tenmangū,” Sugawara no Michizane as Tenjin Traveling to China Artist: Sengai Gibon (Japanese, 1750–1837) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 17 3/16 × 15 1/16 in.

78056.jpg	Sparrow and Bamboo	Sakai Hōitsu	Japanese	ca. 1821	In this narrow composition a sparrow balances on a branchlet of bamboo; the silvery tones of the primary stalk contrast with the dark ink of its leaves and joints. Sakai Hōitsu is best known for his revival of the art of Rinpa-school master Ogata Kōrin (1658–1716) and for his polychrome paintings in the Rinpa style. He was also a master of ink, however, as this lively collaborative work indicates. Kameda Bōsai, a Confucian scholar, inscribed colophons on paintings by several important artists of his day, including Hōitsu and his younger follower Suzuki Kiitsu (1799–1858). Here, his cursive calligraphy appears just below Hōitsu’s perching sparrow. Bōsai often claimed to work while intoxicated, which may account for the hasty but animated quality of his brushwork.	酒井抱一筆亀田鵬斎賛 竹雀図 Title: Sparrow and Bamboo Artist: Sakai Hōitsu (Japanese, 1761–1828) Artist: Calligraphy by Kameda Bōsai (Japanese, 1752–1826) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1821 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 44 3/8 × 14 3/4 in.

78065.jpg	Dutchman with a Servant	Attributed to Kawahara Keiga	Japanese	early 19th century	This is painting was inspired by an early print of the 1750s entitled “Hollander” (Orandajin no zu) that was produced by the publisher Hariya in Nagasaki, the only port foreigners were allowed to enter Japan for most of the Edo period. That print, which became a template for countless subsequent prints and paintings of Dutch figures, identifies the dandily dressed figure with bright blue eyes and long, curly blond hair as the kapitan, referring to the opperhoofd, the manager of the Dutch factory on the island of Deshima (off the shore of Nagasaki). He puffs on a long clay pipe, reminding us that tobacco and its consumption was an insidious import from Europe in the mid to late sixteenth century, and then was grown locally. The opperhoofd wears tight leggings and an overly fancy long jacket of Dutch colonialists, manufactured in Asia by local tailors. His Javanese servant holding the parasol in the early print is referred to as a kurobō, a derogatory term used for black slaves abducted in the East Indies. Though not signed, the work is in the meticulous but stiff Western style of painting associated with Kawahara Keiga, the most prolific portraitist of the Dutch community in Deshima.

667297.jpg	Plum Blossoms	Painting by Matsumura Keibun 松村景文	Japanese	ca. 1823	The blossoming of plum trees in the early spring—a symbol of resilience against winter’s oppressive cold—has long been a favorite subject for ink paintings by East Asian artists. Matsumura Keibun, one of the foremost painters of the Kyoto-based Shijō school, adhered to conventions from Chinese painting manuals for suggesting a sense of depth through the rendering of intertwined tree branches. The variegated grays against an expansive blank background create a boldly graphic composition, while the animated strokes of the new shoots impart dynamism. Keibun was well versed in Ming (1368–1644)- and Qing (1644–1912)-dynasty art theory, and had close ties to sinologists in Kyoto intellectual circles. Among these literati was Rai San’yō, the author and calligrapher of the Chinese poem on the theme of “Plum Blossoms Reflected in Water,” which is brushed on the reverse of this freestanding single screen.	松村景文筆 頼山陽書 梅図衝立屏風 Title: Plum Blossoms Artist: Painting by Matsumura Keibun 松村景文 (Japanese, 1779–1843) Artist: Calligraphy by Rai San’yō 頼山陽 (Japanese, 1780–1832) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1823 Culture: Japan Medium: Freestanding screen (tsuitate); ink on paper Dimensions: H.

Here he has depicted the emiment early-medieval monk Daitō Kokushi (Shūhō Myōchō, 1283–1337) in the guise of a beggar in a straw cloak and tattered sedge hat. The monk lived as a recluse for many years in Kyoto, taking refuge under Gojō Bridge. Daitō Kokushi ultimately established his legacy by founding Daitokuji in Kyoto, the great monastic complex of Rinzai Zen Buddhism. Hakuin considered Daitō Kokushi to be the head of lineage and thus painted many images of him; Shunsō followed in this tradition.

77196.jpg	Egrets in a Lotus Pond	Yamamoto Baiitsu	Japanese	1852	A flock of egrets has descended upon a pond where lotus plants are bursting into bloom. Yamamoto Baiitsu, one of the most prolific and highly esteemed Nanga (Literati) painters of the Owari domain (present-day Nagoya), was renowned for his bird-and-flower paintings and ink landscapes. This composition departs from his standard output by taking the two primary pictorial motifs—egrets and lotuses—and repeating them in profusion. The effective use of perspective adds a naturalistic flavor to the depiction not often found in the artist’s works. Baiitsu also mastered the “boneless” (mokkotsu) painting technique, in which outlines are discarded and pigments naturally pool to form the edges of forms, as seen in the rendering of the lotus leaves.	山本梅逸筆 蓮池白鷺図 Title: Egrets in a Lotus Pond Artist: Yamamoto Baiitsu (Japanese, 1783–1856) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1852 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 50 × 21 13/16 in.

640049.jpg	Lake Biwa in Four Seasons	Nukina Kaioku	Japanese	1834	Lake Biwa, the largest inland body of water in Japan and a famous scenic locale, is captured in a panoramic view that spans the four seasons. Beginning on the right side of the right screen, grasses and budding flowers amid evergreen pine trees suggest spring, while lush willows on the shore convey a summer mood. The left screen—following Chinese landscape traditions rather than describing the actual appearance of the lake’s environs—shows a formation of geese and depicts an autumnal scene, which gives way to a stark mountainous winter landscape. Each screen is inscribed with Chinese seasonal poems brushed in Kaioku’s elegant hand. In the inscription on the right, the calligrapher-painter Kaioku recalls the late spring outing to the lake during which he composed the poem. Revered as one of the Bakumatsu no Sanpitsu, or “Three Great Calligraphers of the End of the Edo Period,” Kaioku was the son of a samurai in the service of the daimyo of Tokushima, Awa Province.	四季琵琶湖図屏風 Title: Lake Biwa in Four Seasons Artist: Nukina Kaioku (Japanese, 1778–1863) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1834 Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 24 9/16 × 60 5/8 in.

His skin, his jewelry, and the nearby foliage bear touches of color, but the landscape surrounding him is rendered in monochrome brushwork and ink wash. The iconography and composition follow a model imported from China centuries earlier, established in Japan by Zen monk-painters of the Muromachi period (1392–1573). Above the figure, the words of the “Kannon-gyō”—a section of the twenty-fifth chapter of the sacred text Lotus Sutra—are inscribed in gold pigment by the artist.Sakai Hōitsu studied the artistic vocabulary of various schools but is best known for his Rinpa compositions, based on literary and seasonal themes and inspired by the work of Ogata Kōrin (1658–1716). Having become a Buddhist monk at age thirty-seven he also produced Buddhist images, of which this is an example.	酒井抱一筆 白衣観音図 Title: White-Robed Kannon Artist: Sakai Hōitsu (Japanese, 1761–1828) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1823 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold on silk Dimensions: Image: 33 5/8 × 14 in.

The calligrapher, Suetaka, was a well-known man of letters within the circles of intellectuals, writers, and artists of western Japan, and also served as a priest at the Kamigamo Shrine in Kyoto. The sketch-like paintings present images associated with festivals or activities of the twelve months of the year. Among these are the Kamo horserace (by Kishi Ganku), the Hinamatsuri doll festival (by Hara Zaichū), and the Iwashimizu Hōjō-e (byYoshimura Kōkei), in which animals (in this case birds and a tortoise) were released from captivity with prayers for the ruling emperor or shogun. Maruyama Ōzui’s chrysanthemums refers to the ninth day of the ninth month, when cloths were soaked with dew from chrysanthemums which was then applied to the face for its supposed powers of rejuvenation.	諸画家 加茂季鷹賛 「神妙画帖」 Title: Painting Album of Sublime Talent Artist: Various artists Artist: Calligraphy by Kamo no Suetaka (Japanese, 1752–1842) Period: Edo Period (1615-1868) Date: ca. 1815 Culture: Japan Medium: Album of twelve leaves; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Page: H. 11 3/4 in.

The compositions are distinctive for their array of related springtime and autumnal plants and flowers, all with poetic significance in haiku of the period. While hanging-scroll paintings by Sakai Hōitsu abound, only a half dozen or so pairs of screens in this six-panel format are known to survive, and these in particular stand out for their originality of composition, strong visual impact, and projection of lyrical elegance.This work can be dated to late in Hōitsu’s career, when he was joined in his studio by his closest and most talented pupil, Suzuki Kiitsu (1796–1858).	酒井抱一筆 桜楓図屏風 Title: Cherry and Maple Trees Artist: Sakai Hōitsu (Japanese, 1761–1828) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 1820s Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink, color, and gold leaf on paper Dimensions: Image (each): 62 3/8 in. × 11 ft. 2 5/8 in.

Although the landscape is rendered simply in ink monochrome, the thick fur and sinuous muscularity of the tigers are painted in detail, with the color wash on their coats and the yellow silk background around them creating the impression of sunlight.Chikudō, the fourth-generation head of the Kyoto-based Kishi school, advocated the practice of sketching from life and could have seen live tigers starting in the late 1860s. Like the founder of the school, Ganku, he became famous for his meticulous tiger paintings, one of which was exhibited at the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893. The artist and several of his late Edo- and Meiji-period contemporaries were active in establishing a painting style that blended traditional Japanese painting with elements of Western realism and perspective.	岸竹堂筆 虎図屏風 Title: Tiger, Tigress and Cub Artist: Kishi Chikudō (Japanese, 1826–1897) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: 1892 Culture: Japan Medium: Pair of six-panel folding screens; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Overall (each): 68 1/8 in. × 14 ft. 2 3/4 in.

816217.jpg	Chinese Poem about a Bamboo Grove	Ryōkan Taigu	Japanese	early 19th century	At first glance the cursive Chinese calligraphy by the monk Ryōkan Taigu seems, even to those trained in the language, to be somewhat sloppy, almost childish in appearance, and illegible in places. But this disarmingly simple, artless, and exuberant style of brush writing—utterly individual and idiosyncratic—earned Ryōkan esteem as one of the great Zen calligraphers of all time.Though trained as a Sōtō Zen monk, he renounced the rigors of a monastic regimen and opted to live mostly as a recluse, becoming known as an eccentric. He was dedicated to poetry in both Chinese and Japanese, especially the haiku form. Examples of his verse brushed in his own distinctive hand were avidly sought in his own day—and still are today.	良寛大愚筆 五言詩 「余家有竹林」 Title: Chinese Poem about a Bamboo Grove Artist: Ryōkan Taigu (Japanese, 1758–1831) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 49 7/16 × 19 1/16 in.

816259.jpg	Jurōjin	Gan Ku (Kishi Ganku)	Japanese	1838	Jurōjin, one of the Seven Gods of Good Fortune, depicted wearing a tall cap and leaning on a bamboo staff, is accompanied by a deer, who holds a magical fungus in its mouth. A rolled up scroll tied to the end of the deity’s bamboo staff seems to be tangled in the branches above. Kishi Ganku, who studied paintings of the Maruyama-Shijō school and others when he was in his twenties, later established his own artistic lineage, whose members endeavored to meld Japanese painting styles with elements of Western realism. While his handling of the trees and rocks follows a standard Japanese approach to landscape, his treatment of Jurōjin’s facial features exhibits a characteristic interest in naturalism.	岸駒筆 寿老人図 Title: Jurōjin Artist: Gan Ku (Kishi Ganku) (Japanese, 1749–1838) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1838 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 55 1/16 × 22 7/16 in.

816260.jpg	Autumn Festival in the Mountains	Okada Hankō	Japanese	first half 19th century	This tall and narrow composition captures a scene from an autumn harvest festival, with visitors to a mountain temple surrounded by hazy mist. In the front courtyard, three figures are seated around a stone table. A young servant prepares tea for the group, fanning a stove to heat a kettle of water. Like his father, Okada Beisanjin (1744–1820), Hankō was a master of literati painting. He rendered this joyous scene using the rhythmic brushstrokes characteristic of the style. For two generations, the Okada were active members of the literati circle in Osaka, where Hankō also inherited his family’s rice store.	岡田半江筆 「溪山秋社図」 Title: Autumn Festival in the Mountains Artist: Okada Hankō (Japanese, 1782–1846) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: first half 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on satin Dimensions: Image: 55 7/16 × 15 1/16 in.

816261.jpg	Emperor Enyū’s Outing to Funaokayama on the First Day of the Rat in the New Year	Reizei Tamechika	Japanese	19th century	This composition in ink with touches of light color depicts the 10th century Emperor Enyū and his entourage on an outing from Kyoto to the mountain of Funaokayama—an ancient reference point for the northerly direction—in the New Year. The work, created with soft brushstrokes and wash for the landscape elements and finer ink lines for the figures, has deliberate stylistic antecedents in the yamato-e style of narrative painting from the twelfth through fourteenth centuries, in the late Heian and Kamakura periods. The courtiers, robed in either black or white and sporting the usual tall, lacquered courtier’s caps, are scattered throughout the composition; two carriages (of the ox-drawn type used by aristocrats) stand in the foreground.The artist, Tamechika, is as fascinating as his paintings. He was an important painter of the final decades of the Edo period, and influential in the revival of the classical yamato-e style of painting and narrative illustration. He produced numerous copies of medieval paintings in order to re-introduce their styles to the public, and venerated the courtly lifestyle of the ancient past. Due to the volatile political climate of the final years of shogunal power, just prior to the re-establishment of imperial sovereignty, Tamechika’s social connections with both imperial courtiers and military lords in service to the shogun led to his assassination by a band of warriors near Nara.	冷泉為恭筆 圓融院船岡山子日御遊図 Title: Emperor Enyū’s Outing to Funaokayama on the First Day of the Rat in the New Year Artist: Reizei Tamechika (1823–1864) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 61 13/16 × 37 1/2 in.

816262.jpg	Waka Poem: “Across the fields and hills…”	Ōtagaki Rengetsu	Japanese	19th century	Otagaki Rengetsu took vows as a Buddhist nun, but is better remembered as one of the foremost waka poets of the nineteenth century, an ink painter, a skilled calligrapher in a refreshingly simple and elegant style, and a prolific potter who inscribed poems into ceramic teaware. A daughter of a courtesan of the licensed brothel quarters and wealthy samurai, she was adopted at a young age into the Ōtagaki clan, and became a lady-in-waiting at Kameoka Castle. She married twice and had five children, but after the death of her second husband in 1823 and the tragic death of all her children she became a nun, taking the Buddhist sobriquet Rengetsu (“Lotus Moon”). She lived in huts in various temple precincts until 1865, when she settled at the Jinkō’in temple, where she lived as nun and created art for the remainder of her life. She became an intimate friend of and mentor to the great Literati artist Tomioka Tessai, and they often collaborated on works.Here the poem, calligraphy and painting are all by Rengetsu. The poem reads: のに山にうかれうかれてかえるさをねやまでおくる秋のよの月 No ni yama ni ukare ukarete kaerusa oneya made okuru aki no yo no tsuki Across the fields and hillsmy spirits buoyed with joy—Making my way back, accompanied to my bedroom, by this autumn’s night moon.

812305.jpg	Courtesan as Daruma	Attributed to Utagawa Toyoharu	Japanese	ca. 1800; inscription ca. 1810	Though a painting of a young woman, the red cape and cowl are associated with traditional imagery of Daruma (Bodhidharma), the legendary monk who traveled from India to China to establish Chan (Zen) Buddhism, who is often depicted in similar garb. The painting here, unsigned but most likely by Toyoharu based on stylistic considerations, is intended as a parodic depiction of a Yoshiwara courtesan. The poem by Shokusanjin plays on Buddhist phrases related to the Daruma’s nine years of zazen meditation in a cave to connote a drinking party.Drinking sake aged nine years, along with crumbs of snacks such as Zazen beans, we realize that originally there was nothing at all.	伝歌川豊春筆 蜀山人（太田南畝）賛 女達磨図 Title: Courtesan as Daruma Artist: Attributed to Utagawa Toyoharu (Japanese, 1735–1814) Period: Edo period (1615-1868) Date: ca. 1800; inscription ca. 1810 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 29 1/4 in. × 10 in.

815476.jpg	The Spirit of the Deceased Yūgao Entwined in Moonflower Vines, based on the print “The Lady of the Evening Faces,” from the series One Hundred Aspects of the Moon (Tsuki hyakushi: Genji Yūgao no maki)	Tsukioka Yoshitoshi	Japanese	ca. 1892	As witnessed in works by other late Edo-period artists like Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1797-1861), a fascination with memorializing scenes from Japanese literature that capture elements of the supernatural and macabre flourished in the late 1800s. Though Tsukioka Yoshitoshi was a pupil of Kuniyoshi, he was influenced by the modernization of Japan and modern media, and sometimes produced violent and disturbing images. Ultimately, however, he became nostalgic for the disappearing traditional culture and ukiyo-e style. In this painting, the semitransparent spirit of the deceased Yūgao is wraithlike and blue-lipped in the moonlight, with “evening faces” moonflower vines encircling her.	月岡芳年筆 「月百姿 源氏夕顔巻」 Title: The Spirit of the Deceased Yūgao Entwined in Moonflower Vines, based on the print “The Lady of the Evening Faces,” from the series One Hundred Aspects of the Moon (Tsuki hyakushi: Genji Yūgao no maki) Artist: Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (Japanese, 1839–1892) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: ca. 1892 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 41 1/4 × 16 in.

The scene of Murasaki at her desk, about to begin writing her monumental tale, was an obvious choice, having been depicted by artists of every school. His painted rendition of the setting, however, diverges from the usual one. Rather than show a view of Lake Biwa, he depicted the outcrops of wollastonite stone surrounding Ishiyamadera (Stony Mountain Temple). From the main hall of the temple, there actually is no direct vista of the lake or vantage point with such craggy features, but the references are clear.	月岡芳年筆 「月百姿 石山の月」 Title: Murasaki Shikibu at Ishiyamadera Temple, based on the print “The Moon at Ishiyama,” from the series One Hundred Aspects of the Moon (Tsuki hyakushi: Ishiyama no tsuki) Artist: Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (Japanese, 1839–1892) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: ca. 1892 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 41 1/4 × 16 in.

Early on he studied with the Kano school painter Tōda Eiun 桃田英雲in Osaka. Some sources say that Nukina Kaioku became his teacher of calligraphy and painting for a while. He also became acquainted with the merchant and scholar of classical Japanese literature Satoi Fukyu里井浮丘 who lived in his hometown of Izumi. Fukyu had a large collection of paintings and calligraphy, and also through Fukyu was introduced to the important Nanga painter Okada Hankō, with whom he studied.	日根対山筆 「林塘秋暇」 Title: “At leisure in a lakeside grove in autumn” Artist: Hine Taizan (Japanese, 1813–1869) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1850 Culture: Japan Medium: Two-panel folding screen Dimensions: Image: 60 × 60 in.

Random in arrangement and disjunctive in perspectival and spatial relationships, the images are a cornucopia of pictorial elements representing sundry aspects of life in Edo (present-day Tokyo) during the early nineteenth century.

705791.jpg	Willow Kannon	Sakai Hōitsu	Japanese	probably 1810s	While Sakai Hōitsu is most closely associated with Rinpa, a dozen or so paintings of Buddhist deities by him and his circle are known today, in polychrome as well as in ink. Here, the miniature Amida Buddha in his tall crown, the willow branch in his right hand, and the vase in his left identify this deity as Willow (Yōryū) Kannon. The willow branch is believed to ward off evil and illness, while the bottle contains a nectar with healing powers. The outer cape, rendered with compulsive detail, suggests an otherworldly aura. The signature indicates that the painting was based on a model attributed to the Chinese Tang-dynasty master Wu Daozi. Nothing in Wu’s hand survives, however, and his work is known only through later copies and ink rubbings.	酒井抱一筆 楊柳観音図 Title: Willow Kannon Artist: Sakai Hōitsu (Japanese, 1761–1828) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: probably 1810s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, and gold leaf on silk Dimensions: Image: 32 5/8 × 14 1/8 in.

829405.jpg	Hototogisu			early 19th century	A hototogisu, a Japanese variety of cuckoo, descends in flight against the backdrop of a full moon emerging from a bank of clouds. The painting encapsulates the atmosphere of an evening whose silence broken by the song of the hototogisu, a visual and literary metaphor celebrated in Japan since ancient times—often referring to the sad departure of a male lover after a nocturnal tryst. Filling the blank spaces on the silk is an assortment of poetic inscriptions by associates of the artist, men of letters of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Numerous collaborative works of this type exist from the era, often executed in this particular format, with kyōka (popular, often witty or playful verses) poems accompanying a small image. Horizontal bands of ink and light color contribute to the evocative quality of the painting. Kubo Shunman, a kyōka master as well as a painter and a designer of woodblock prints, lived and worked in Edo (Tokyo), where he studied ukiyo-e painting, composed poetry under various names, produced woodblock prints for book illustrations, and gained renown for his witty, sometimes satirical verse. This hanging scroll is evidence of his activity in the lively kyōka poetry circles of Edo sophisticates and literary men of his day.	窪俊満筆 大田南畝賛 石川雅望賛 浅草庵市人賛 四方真顔賛 時鳥図 Title: Hototogisu Artist: Kubo Shunman (Japanese, 1757–1820) Calligrapher: Ōta Nanpo (Japanese, 1749–1823) Calligrapher: Rokujuen 六樹園 (1753–1830) Calligrapher: Asakusaan Ichindo (Japanese, 1755–1820) Calligrapher: Yomo Magao (Japanese, 1753–1829) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 36 1/16 × 11 7/8 in.

829407.jpg	High Mountains, Flowing Water: Yu Boya and Zhong Ziqi	Okura Ryūzan	Japanese	ca. 1840	Zhong Ziqi, a music connoisseur who lived in China during the fourth century BCE, once encountered the statesman Yu Boya masterfully performing on the qin (zither). The two became extremely close friends and confidants, eventually coauthoring the tale depicted in this painting, Tall Mountains, Flowing Water, about their enduring friendship. In Okura Ritsuzan’s interpretation, this companionship unfolds in a contemporary Chinese garden—a setting the Sinophiles of the Edo period would have favored. Yu sits on a large Taihu rock, playing the qin, while Zhong listens intently. Nearby, a young servant fans a stove to prepare sencha. A set of small teacups lies ready on the stone table.	大倉笠山筆 「高山流水図」 Title: High Mountains, Flowing Water: Yu Boya and Zhong Ziqi Artist: Okura Ryūzan (Japanese, 1785–1850) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1840 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 51 9/16 × 16 5/8 in.

Eroded ornamental garden rocks like those from Lake Tai identify the scene as taking place in China. A hazy moon hangs in the sky while bands of mist, rendered by unpainted areas of silk, obscure the far distance. The poetic title derives from an early, perhaps original, box inscription.Nakabayashi Chikutō was born the son of a doctor in Nagoya, where he became the protégé of a well-to-do collector of Chinese paintings. He eventually moved to Kyoto with Yamamoto Baiitsu (1783–1856), and both became artists of the Nanga (Literati) school. In addition to painting, he designed images for woodblock-printed illustrated books and authored a number of painting treatises.

A boatman poles his vessel past the dangerous current and foreground rocks. Roshū, student and adopted son of the renowned and individualistic artist Nagasawa Rosetsu (1754–1799), whose works are exhibited nearby, demonstrates his skill with the brush as well as a sense of drama, perhaps encouraged by his untrammeled teacher. Roshū was an artist in the refined Maruyama-Shijō tradition, to which his adoptive father had initially belonged but later renounced; this painting contains only hints of Rosetsu’s vigorous and dynamic mature style.	長澤蘆州筆 月下遊舟図 Title: Boat under the Moon Artist: Nagasawa Roshū 長澤蘆洲 (Japanese, 1767–1847) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 41 1/4 × 16 9/16 in.

829411.jpg	Spring Sunrise at Mount Penglai	Tanomura Chokunyū	Japanese	1881	This idealized spring scene, rendered in the blue-green palette of traditional Chinese landscape paintings, vividly imagines a sanctuary for the literati. A luxurious Chinese-style villa sits on the water’s edge at the foot of verdant mountains. Two scholarly figures engage in conversation within its main hall, while servants perform tasks on the grounds—one feeding a crane and another sweeping. The accompanying poem describes this setting as the legendary Mount Penglai, the island of the immortals in Chinese mythology.Tanomura Chokunyū was a Kyoto-based literati painter and disciple of Tanomura Chikuden (1777–1835). He served as the founding president of the Kyoto Prefectural School of Painting (now Kyoto City University of Arts).	田能村直入筆 蓬莱春旭図 Title: Spring Sunrise at Mount Penglai Artist: Tanomura Chokunyū (Japanese, 1814–1907) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: 1881 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 58 7/8 × 25 7/8 in.

829412.jpg	Su Dongpo Laughing	Suzuki Shōnen	Japanese	1892	The famous Chinese poet Su Dongpo (Su Shi, 1037–1101) of the Song dynasty and three richly clad women stand in a space filled with the ideal accoutrements and furnishings of a scholar-gentleman: carved bookcases littered with books, flowers, and ornamental objects, small tables displaying more decorative objects, a carpeted dais, and the convoluted and perforated rocks, often called Lake Tai rocks, with which scholars loved to ornament their studies. The poet converses with the woman facing him, while the other two ladies speak with each other. There appears to be a narrative element to this image, and it is possible that it represents a popular story about the poet, his verbal exchange with a Chan (Zen) Buddhist monk named Foyin, and his laughter when he returned home and recounted the meeting to his sister. It may also reference an anecdote in which Su Dongpo asked his concubine and maid servants if they knew what his belly was full of. As the poet is shown resting one hand on his protruding stomach, the latter tale may have been the inspiration. The Kyoto-based Shōnen was a professional painter, the son of Suzuki Hyakunen, an artist who worked in the Shijō and Nanga styles of painting. Shōnen became head of the northern division of the Kyoto Prefecture Painting School in 1881, and he displayed his art and won awards at both domestic and international exhibitions, including the World’s Columbian Exhibition in Chicago, and the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900. This painting is an unusual work within Shōnen’s oeuvre, as many of his compositions consist of landscapes or pine trees painted in ink with only light touches of color.	鈴木松年筆 蘇東坡先生捧腹図 Title: Su Dongpo Laughing Artist: Suzuki Shōnen (Japanese, 1849–1918) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: 1892 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scrolls; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image (painting): 47 1/4 × 16 9/16 in.

752013.jpg	Lady-in-Waiting at Edo Castle	Utagawa Kuniyoshi 歌川國芳	Japanese	ca. 1854–60 (Ansei era)	A young woman, her cheeks flushed a faint pink, rests an arm on a low, single-panel wooden screen as she gazes intently at some activity in the distance. Her dark grey outer robe bears a design of green leaves and pink blossoms; the dark orange obi around her waist is decorated with repeated floral motifs. A bright red robe and white under robe are visible at her neck, and her high chignon is tied with white cloth ribbons and features a hairpin terminating in a gilded ornament in the shape of a cluster of cherry blossoms. From her costume, hairstyle and an old inscription on the storage box, we can identify her as one of the ladies-in-waiting based permanently in the women’s quarters (ōoku) of the Shogun’s castle in Edo.Her long, narrow oval face is typical of many of the Kuniyoshi’s depictions of women. In the manner of many ukiyo-e painters, from the late 17th century to the 19th, Kuniyoshi left the background blank, and here the figure and the screen fill almost the entire picture plane.	大奥女中芝居見物図 Title: Lady-in-Waiting at Edo Castle Artist: Utagawa Kuniyoshi 歌川國芳 (Japanese, 1797–1861) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1854–60 (Ansei era) Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 35 7/8 × 11 1/2 in.

841644.jpg	Collaborative Painting of Sixteen Arhats			late 1870s–early 1880s	For this collaboration, sixteen artists depicted one each of the Sixteen Arhats (Japanese: Jūroku Rakan), a group of Buddhist saints who reject all worldly passions and exist in various realms of the Buddhist world in order to promulgate the so-called Just Law—the true teachings of the Buddha, which are inherently prone to degeneration over time. The sixteen artists were all key players in painting circles in the city of Kyoto in the 1880s. They include major figues like Mori Kansai, who, after the death of the leading painter Shiokawa Bunrin (1808–1877), stood at the center of Kyoto painting circles as the head of the Kyoto painting group Jounsha, many of whose members can also be found among the collaborators. The late Bunrin’s own son, Ichidō, painted the partially hidden figure in profile at middle left. Another particularly important collaborator on this work, and along with Mori Kansai the oldest of the group, is Tanomura Chokunyū. Chokunyū was a leading figure of the literati painting movement, which is also well represented in this work. A number of the painters are associated with the naturalistic painting style of the Shijō School. Nearly all the painters whose names and pictures appear on this work were at one time or another after its founding in 1880 affiliated with the Kyoto Prefectural School of Painting (Kyōto-fu Ga-gakkō), Japan’s first ever art educational institution. In addition to one of its founders, Kōno Bairei, well over half of the artist’s represented in this work are known to have taught at the school in the 1880s.	十六羅漢図合作 (Jūroku rakan zu gassaku) Title: Collaborative Painting of Sixteen Arhats Artist: Suzuki Hyakunen 鈴木百年 (Japanese, 1825–1891) Artist: Amano Hōko 天野方壺 (Japanese, 1828–1894) Artist: Tomioka Tessai (Japanese, 1836–1924) Artist: Tanomura Chokunyū 田能村直入 (Japanese, 1814–1907) Artist: Murata Kōkoku 村田香谷 (Japanese, 1831–1912) Artist: Shiokawa Ichidō 塩川一堂 (Japanese, active late 19th–early 20th century) Artist: Morikawa Sōbun 森川曾文 (Japanese, 1847–1902) Artist: Imao Keinen 今尾景年 (Japanese, 1845–1924) Artist: Suzuki Shōnen (Japanese, 1849–1918) Artist: Mori Kansai (Japanese, 1814–1894) Artist: Asai Hakuzan (Japanese, 1842–1907) Artist: Ikeda Unshō 池田雲樵 (Japanese, 1825–1886) Artist: Shige Shuntō 重春塘 (Japanese, 1833–1904) Artist: Murase Gyokuden 村瀬玉田 (Japanese, 1852–1917) Artist: Yamanaka Shūhan 山中秋帆 (Japanese, 1832–1892) Artist: Kōno Bairei (Japanese, 1844–1895) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: late 1870s–early 1880s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on satin Dimensions: Image: 63 3/4 in. × 26 in.

826905.jpg	Scene Inspired by the Scrolls of Frolicking Animals and Humans	Tomioka Tessai	Japanese	1890s	This small work by Tomioka Tessai, often described as one of the last great artists of Japan’s literati painting tradition, is a reworking of a scene from one of the most celebrated works in the history of Japanese painting—the twelfth-century Scrolls of Frolicking Animals and Humans (Chōjū jinbutsu giga). Designated a National Treasure by the Japanese government, the Chōjū giga scrolls, as they are called colloquially, consist of four handscrolls depicting a variety of anthropomorphized animals, mythical beasts, and humans engaging in a variety of activities. The present work reimagines an iconic scene from the set’s first scroll that shows a group of animals—rabbits, foxes, and monkeys—dressed as Buddhist monks and worshipping before a frog masquerading as the Buddha. For his picture, Tessai takes eleven figures from the ancient original’s horizontal composition, adjusting their relative size and locations within the composition to accommodate the smaller vertical format. Most prominent is the frog-buddha, who sits in meditation atop a lotus pedestal and before whom fox-, monkey- and rabbit-monks chant Buddhist sutras.	鳥獣戯画の場面 Title: Scene Inspired by the Scrolls of Frolicking Animals and Humans Artist: Tomioka Tessai (Japanese, 1836–1924) Period: Meiji Period (1868–1912) Date: 1890s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on satin Dimensions: Image: 26 5/8 × 23 1/4 in.

841600.jpg	Shellfish and Apparitions of the Yoshiwara Pleasure Quarter	Chōbunsai Eishi	Japanese	ca. 1811	This triptych of paintings by the noted Ukiyo e painter Eishi takes up the most unusual subject of scenes of the Yoshiwara pleasure quarters as dream like apparitions emanating from shellfish. Reflecting the painter’s diverse training as a young man, the shellfish and plum branches are very much in Kano ink wash style, while the figures are in Ukiyo e polychrome. About 1785, after Eishi had given three years of service to the shogunate, he switched his artistic affiliation from the academic style to Ukiyo e, specializing in woodblock prints and paintings of courtesans.Most remarkably, the surrounding mounting silks of this triptych are inscribed with witty poems and popular songs related to Yoshiwara in the distinctive hand of the poet calligrapher and literary celebrity Ōta Nanpo, better known by his pen name Shokusanjin.	鳥文斎栄之筆 蜀山人（大田 南畝）賛 吉原の蜃気楼図 Title: Shellfish and Apparitions of the Yoshiwara Pleasure Quarter Artist: Chōbunsai Eishi (Japanese, 1756–1829) Calligrapher: Shokusanjin (Ōta Nanpo) (Japanese, 1749–1823) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1811 Culture: Japan Medium: Triptych of hanging scrolls with inscribed mountings; painting: ink and color on silk; calligraphy: ink on silk mounting fabric Dimensions: Image (each): 35 1/4 × 12 3/4 in.

826900.jpg	Scenes of the Buddhist Hell	Shōsai 松斎	Japanese	second half 19th century	This dynamic painting depicts the Buddhist hell. Most of the composition shows detailed descriptions of the types of suffering that await souls reborn in hell, with an array of punishments meted out by muscular, half-nude demons with red or green skin. In the upper left corner, for example, two naked figures on a platform attempt to escape as a green-skinned demon beats them. Nearby, another hapless soul is bound upside down to a tree, watching in horror and awaiting his own punishment. Elsewhere, demons march lost souls into a pool of molten lava. A scene in the bottom third of the picture shows a group of children in a graveyard, some attempting to escape from an approaching demon. Others beg for mercy from Jizō, who appears here as a monk. Another scene in an upper register of the painting shows individuals kneeling before the King of Hell, who sits at a large table. He is flanked by attendants that assess the various sins committed by the deceased in his or her previous life.	地獄図 Title: Scenes of the Buddhist Hell Artist: Shōsai 松斎 (Japanese, active second half of the 19th century) Period: Edo (1615–1868)–Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: second half 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 76 15/16 × 33 1/4 in.

845131.jpg	Chinese Poem Extolling a Reclusive Lifestyle	Jakugon Taijō	Japanese	mid-18th century	Unaffiliated with Zen sects but working in the Zen calligraphy tradition, the Shingon monk Jakugon Taijō achieved recognition as a scholar of Sanskrit and a calligrapher. He is considered one of the great monk-calligraphers of the Edo period, alongside Jiun Onkō and Ryōkan Taigu, also represented in the Cowles Collection. The inscribed poem, by the Chinese poet Li Panlong (1514–1570), reads:君去何時歸 山中春草夕莫将白雲廬 不及紅塵陌Now that you are leaving, when might you return To the spring grasses in the mountains at dusk?Do you really believe that a thatched hut shrouded in white cloudsDoes not have more to offer than the mundane realm of red dust?	寂厳諦乗筆 李攀竜五言絶句 Title: Chinese Poem Extolling a Reclusive Lifestyle Artist: Jakugon Taijō (Japanese, 1702–1771) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: mid-18th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 49 7/8 × 21 1/2 in.

845132.jpg	Moon amid Clouds	Inscription by Seisetsu Shūcho 誠拙周樗	Japanese	early 19th century	A gibbous moon, rendered in reserve, shines through a bank of ink-wash clouds, which seem to gnaw at the edges of the lunar orb—almost abstract in conception. The painting, profoundly Zen in its minimalism and mysterious expressiveness, is unsigned so the only clue we have about the identity of who brushed it is the double-seal reading “Gekijō” 撃壤. Here the phrase on the seal derives from the four-character saying Kofuku gekijō 鼓腹撃壌, meaning, literally, “to pat one’s belly and stamp the ground,” which is a roundabout way of expressing the blissful feeling of “everything in the world is at peace.”We have yet to identify the artist who used this seal, though during the time the Rinzai monk-calligrapher Seisetsu Shūcho was active there was a Nanga artist named Ōta Gekijōshi, who lived in Komatsushima on Shikoku island, coincidentally, perhaps, not far from where Seisetsu was born. Though at this point it remains complete speculation whether this seal might have been used by Gekijōshi, it seems too much of a coincidence that his patron, student and confidante later in his life was a scholar-monk named Kankanshi 閑々子 (1752–1827), who had trained at a Zen temple Seisetsu was also affiliated with early in his life. Kankanshi at the end of his career retired to Komatsushima where he took painting lessons from Gekijōshi. So there is a possibility Kankanshi had requested the painting from his teacher and the calligraphy from the famous Zen-monk calligrapher—but this hypothesis requires further investigation.In the eccentric calligraphy by Seisetsu, the shape of the characters comes across as intentionally deformed, breaking rules of handwriting, and almost whimsical in appearance. The silhouettes of the characters are deliberately exaggerated, resonating with the abstract and mysterious ink painting below. The poem evokes imagery of somemisty moonlit night, keeping in mind the moon serves as a metaphor of enlightenment in Zen writings. The character for “wind” 風, second character of the second column from the right draws the eye immediately because of its darker ink tone, and in turn resonates semantically with the image of clouds moving in the evening sky. The characters comprising the monk-calligrapher’s signature, “Inscribed by Seisetsu,” to the lower left of the inscription proper are also highly idiosyncratic, and accompanied by a seal that expresses the spiritual goal of a monk-artist who has dedicated himself to a life of Zen reclusion as opposed to the pursuit of worldly comforts: “Escape into uselessness” (Muyō tonnyū 無用遁入). Perhaps in a nod to his self-deprecating art name, nearly a century later the Taishō Emperor bestowed upon the scholar-monk the posthumous honorary title of Daiyū Kokushi 大用国師, the National Master of Great Usefulness.The poem can be deciphered and tentatively translated as follows:宿雨催初夜風煙猶未収月光隔羅穀 何處誠登楼At the inn rainy weather hastens evening’s arrival. Wind and haze have yet to engulf The moonlight, filtered through the curtains.Where then can we climbthe tower to behold this view?(Trans. John T. Carpenter)Seisetsu, originally from Shikoku, was ordained at the age of seven, and became a wandering monk in his teens. He trained with the charismatic Zen master Gessen Zenne (1701–1781) for a while, and was invited to Engakuji in Kamakura, and consequently switched his affiliation from the Myōshinji to the Engakuji subsect of Rinzai. He remained the abbot there for twenty-eight years, restoring it to greatness as a training temple. Seisetsu eventually had hundreds of disciples, and several of his Dharma-heirs attained influential positions in the Zen hierarchy. At Engakuji, Sengai Gibon (1750–1837), even more famous for his idiosyncratic calligraphy and sketch paintings, was among the trainees. Later, Seisetsu moved to Shōkokuji in Kyoto. A scholar- monk with a wide cultural network—including the daimyo tea master Matsudaira Fumai and the poet Kagawa Kageki—Seisetsu was accomplished as a poet, calligrapher and painter.	月に雲図 (Tsuki ni kumo zu) Title: Moon amid Clouds Artist: Inscription by Seisetsu Shūcho 誠拙周樗 (Japanese, 1745–1820) Artist: Painting by Gekijō 撃壤 (Japanese) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: early 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 42 1/8 × 16 5/16 in.

Wang invited forty-one acquaintances to an outing on the banks of a winding stream, where they composed poetry and drank wine from cups sent downstream. He drafted a preface to the compositions, immortalizing the occasion for generations of literati artists, both in China and Japan. In Hara Zaichū’s interpretation, many of the scholars are garbed in iridescent blue robes along the verdant banks that surround the broad, winding stream—a palette derived from ancient Chinese blue-green (qinglu) painting.

845163.jpg	Wintry Landscape with Trees	Urakami Shunkin (ASA)	Japanese	1833	This intimate, miniature landscape painting—of the variety Uragami Shunkin’s famous father, Gyokudō, also sometimes created—captures the somber mood of a mountain village in late autumn at dusk. In a painting style learned from his father from an early age, employing repeating sharp horizontal strokes to build up the shapes of trees and peaks, the artist contrasts the textures of the rocky outcrops in the foreground with the dreamy mountain peaks in the distance. By the time he created this painting in 1833, Shunkin had already established himself as a Literati painter conversant in the related arts of poetry, calligraphy and playing the koto (Chinese: qin), the musical instrument that had been one of his father’s fortes. Shunkin, who was active in the intellectual and literary circle of Rai Sanyō (1780–1832) and others in Kyoto, also achieved a reputation as a connoisseur of antique paintings, calligraphies, inkstones, and metalwork, all of which he collected himself.As he often did, Shunkin added a Chinese verse in his expert calligraphy to complement and poeticize this painting. Here he brushed four five-character lines that read:木落泉源露草枯山骨癯冷々斜陽影冷々斜陽影層峰半有無Fallen leaves reveal the source of the streamWithered grasses expose the bones of the mountainCool diagonal shadows are cast by the sinking sun.Myriad peaks are half hidden, half seen.(Trans.

845164.jpg	Winter Landscape	Hayashi Hyakuhi 林百非	Japanese	dated 1840	Not a single person populates this vast winter landscape; the only hint of human habitation is suggested by what appears to be a mountain retreat situated about halfway up the composition. In the foreground is a magnificent tangle of trees and plants of various species—meticulously and compulsively brushed in a tour de force of painterly precision and patience. The season is winter, and the leafless branches are carefully outlined in a ying and yang of dark ink and pale gray outlines surrounding areas in reserve. To add to the complexity of the composition, a waterfall forms a backdrop to accentuate the gnarled trunk of an aged tree. As the eye follows the recession of the composition into the background, massive rock outcrops are given three-dimensionality by the use of various texture strokes and ink dots. This imaginary Chinese-style landscape was created by Hayashi Hyakuhi, a samurai painter who spent most of his life in the Chōshū domain (surrounding the modern city of Hagi), where he grew up and was inculcated with study of the Chinese classics and poetry. He first studied painting, calligraphy and seal carving under Yano Katsuzan 矢野括山 (1780–1845）and then under Tanomura Chikuden , the great Nanga master of the era, whose influence is revealed in this work of 1840, Not only was Hyakuhi a skilled painter, he excelled in Chinese poetry, calligraphy and seal carving, while also becoming a scholar of military strategy. Note that the artist often used a seal reading Nyoze 如是, a Buddhist term, and short for jū nyoze 十如是 (the ten thusnesses) of the Tendai sect. In the signature on this work he evocatively refers to his painting studio as the Sansui Nyoze Shooku 山水如是書屋, or the Library of the Thusnesses of Landscape. In the signature, the artist also refers to himself as as Hōgai Shiba 方外司馬, employing a Chinese expression that originated in A New Account of the Tales of the World (Shishuo Xinyu 世說新語, compiled in the fifth century) referring to someone who received a civil service appointment, but who does not comply with all the regulations and restraints required as a condition of his employment. In this context it suggests the outlook of a Literati painter who does not want to conform to the strictures of the samurai society into which he was born. One of the artist’s seal impressed on the left of the painting repeats this name.	冬山水図 (Fuyu sansui zu) Title: Winter Landscape Artist: Hayashi Hyakuhi 林百非 (Japanese, 1797–1851) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: dated 1840 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 41 15/16 in. × 14 in.

845165.jpg	“The Deep Green of Summer Mountains”	Hine Taizan 日根對山	Japanese	1850s	In a Chinese-style landscape, the Literati painter Hine Taizan has meticulously depicted various goings-on of scholars and recluses amid a setting the artist has evocatively entitled “The Deep Green of Summer Mountains,” using the character sui 翠, which connotes the blue-green of kingfisher feathers. In the foreground two scholars have brought books and a qin (zither) to tête-à-tête outdoors upon a rocky outcrop along a mountain stream. Further upstream, amid a sprawling covered walkway along the water’s edge a solitary figure seems to be awaiting friends to appear. Partly hidden in the mountain recesses is a temple complex—symbol of leaving behind the secular world—while in the background are faraway peaks, representing a metaphysical immersion into a spiritual or philosophical realm.Taizan was born in Hine village in Izumi province (present-day Izumi-sano City in Osaka), and arrived in Kyoto in 1837 at age 24, and remained active in the capital until his death at age 57 in 1869. Early on he studied with the Kano school painter Tōda Eiun 桃田英雲 in Osaka. Some sources say that Nukina Kaioku became his teacher of calligraphy and painting for a while. He also became acquainted with the merchant and scholar of classical Japanese literature Satoi Fukyu 里井浮丘 who lived in his hometown of Izumi. Fukyu had a large collection of paintings and calligraphy, and also through Fukyu was introduced to the important Nanga painter Okada Hankō, with whom he studi	「夏山深翠」(Kazan shinsui) Title: “The Deep Green of Summer Mountains” Artist: Hine Taizan 日根對山 (Japanese, 1813–1869) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1850s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 65 7/8 × 32 3/8 in.

845166.jpg	Ink Plum and Bamboo	Hoashi Kyōu 帆足杏雨	Japanese	1856 (Ansei 3)	In a scholar’s garden, an unusually shaped rock with multiple bulbous protrusions, covered in places with moss, stands prominently, resembling a miniature mountain peak. To the left, a stand of bamboo is rendered in a range of ink tones to suggest depth. Behind the rock a gnarled plum tree has burst into bloom, signaling that spring has arrived. The poetic inscription in the upper left corner resonates with the painting by evoking the age-old metaphors of bamboo and plum blossom as symbols of longevity, perseverance, and elegance even in the midst of winter’s cold (or a harsh political climate). The colophon to the poem reveals that the painting was created on the theme of “two friends of winter,” in this case bamboo and flowering plum; the poem was composed in the seventh month of the year 1856, on the occasion of the shared birthday of a friend’s parents.Hayashi Kyōu, born in rural Oita prefecture, studied Nanga under Tanomura Chikuden (1777–1835) in Kyoto, and established his own modern style of ink painting, mostly landscapes, but also other traditional literati themes, as shown here. He was active at the end of the Edo period in the intellectual and literary networks of his day, and skilled in Chinese style verse, which he could write in an admirable hand to add panache to his pictorial compositions.	墨梅竹図 (Boku baichiku zu) Title: Ink Plum and Bamboo Artist: Hoashi Kyōu 帆足杏雨 (Japanese, 1810–1884) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1856 (Ansei 3) Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on satin Dimensions: Image: 56 7/8 × 20 7/16 in.

Omezō was a leading man (tachiyaku) known for his penetrating eyes and distinctive hooknose. In 1858, probably for a memorial service for Ōmezo’s twenty-seventh death anniversary, an inscription was added by prominent Kabuki actor Ichikawa Danjūrō VII (Ebizō V). In distinctive, dynamic cursive calligraphy, he eulogized his mentor, referring to him by the name Sōdai: From the time of my youth, until I became a serious actor, I knew the joys of the path of acting in the Ichikawa lineage, and never lost enthusiasm for the aragoto style, and the acting methods that should last forever.For a long while,he made it his dutyto lend me support fromthe depths of his heart—Ichikawa Sōdai.	初代市川男女蔵像 Title: Memorial Portrait of the Actor Ichikawa Ōmezō I Artist: Painting by Utagawa Kunisada (Japanese, 1786–1864) Artist: Inscription by Ichikawa Danjūrō VII (Japanese, 1791–1859) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: painting ca. 1833; inscription dated 1858 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 35 9/16 × 12 5/8 in.

853216.jpg	Unexpected Meeting on the Yodo River	Rai San’yō 頼山陽	Japanese	1823	This inscribed painting commemorates the literary and artistic friendship of two brilliant late Edo artists, both of whom were talented in the Three Perfections of East Asian art; painting, poetry and calligraphy. The impromptu inscribed painting commemorates a chance meeting in 1823 when the two of them were passing on boat along the Yodo River, near Lake Biwa, a short distance east of Kyoto. Though unsigned, we assume the painting was sketched by Tanomura Chikuden, then Rai San’yō inscribed it twice starting along the right margin of the scroll. Chikuden then added a five-column inscription on the left side of the scroll. They recounted that they had met five years before at Oka Castle in city of Takeda, Kyūshū, which was Chikuden’s hometown. As Chikuden’s inscription testifies, among Nanga painters of his generation, he was one of the most literary and scholarly. As the son of a samurai medical officer and physician, Chikuden was trained in his father's profession, but his artistic talent and a predilection for scholarship led him to resign official duties. He travelled widely and befriended Nanga artists and intellectuals in Kyoto and Osaka, who were a source of artistic inspiration. Journeys over turbulent rivers and bays became a frequent theme of his paintings. He also wrote commentaries on a number of Nanga artists and literati whom he met in Kyoto and Osaka. The Chikuden-sō shiyū garoku (Records of Paintings by Chikuden's Teachers and Friends) includes accounts of the lives of 104 artist-friends and comments on their work. Chikuden's portraits of his friends are full of warmth and sincere affection.The distinguished historian and Confucian scholar Rai Sanyō also established a reputation as Nanga-school painter, calligrapher, and poet. He was born in Osaka and studied in Hiroshima and Edo before settling in Kyoto in 1811, where he opened a academy and devoted himself to the writing of kanshi (verse composed in Chinese by Japanese poets).	澱川邂逅之図 (Yodogawa kaikō no zu) Title: Unexpected Meeting on the Yodo River Artist: Rai San’yō 頼山陽 (Japanese, 1780–1832) Artist: Tanomura Chikuden 田能村竹田 (Japanese, 1777–1835) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1823 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink on paper Dimensions: Image: 50 1/8 × 10 11/16 in.

853219.jpg	Irises	Suzuki Kiitsu 鈴木基一	Japanese	mid-1850s	In a marsh of brilliant blue irises in full bloom in summer, a pair of swallows frolic on the verdant bank in the right scroll, while a kingfisher sits perched on a stump on the left (Fig. 1). This brilliantly colored diptych on silk was created by the celebrated Edo-based painter Suzuki Kiitsu at the end of his career, when the artist was experimenting with a new modern style that combined the traditional graphic—almost decorative—expression of Rinpa painting with a turn toward Western realism. The effect is somewhat surreal and mesmerizing, similar to the visual impact of Irises and Moth from the Mary Griggs Burke Collection, which was created around the same time (Fig. 2, 2015.300.95). For viewers accustomed to the artist’s earlier works created with thickly applied mineral pigments, the first impression may be disconcerting, but it is a reminder that Kiitsu was active right up until the end of the Edo period, and he can be seen as pioneer of a hybrid style of painting that will later be associated with Nihonga, or modern “Japanese-style painting.”Kiitsu, son of a cloth dyer, was the principal pupil of the Rinpa revivalist Sakai Hoitsu (1761–1828), and worked closely with his master from the mid-1810s. Kiitsu assisted the master in the compilation of the Kōrin hyakuzu (One-Hundred Paintings by Kōrin), which served as textbook of the Rinpa idiom of painting and graphic design. Kiitsu left behind a large corpus of paintings, most of which are in style close to Hōitsu, keeping in mind that they probably collaborated on works at the end of the master’s life, and that he sometimes created works on Hōitsu’s behalf.. Kiitsu’s later works, as here, have a distinctive modern flavor.

Although less well known than his adoptive father, Chokunyū was a philanthropist as well as a painter, and is remembered for helping to establish Kyoto’s first art school, now known as the Kyoto City University of Arts (Kyoto Shiritsu Geijutsu Daigaku). He himself was a highly skilled painter in the Nanga tradition, specializing in landscapes executed in styles associated with renowned Chinese artists of the past.Chokunyū provides access to this large landscape in the lower foreground, where a small boat is moored near a small village bustling on a bright autumn day. The composition above is devoted to impenetrable mountain peaks highlighted with ochre, malachite green, and azurite blue. They are dotted with autumnal foliage in red and pink and encircled by swirling white clouds.The inscription above appears to be a poem by Chokunyū himself that more or less describes the scene in the painting. The author extols the beauty of autumn and the flourishing mountain village, before wondering who might be the lord of this prosperous landChokunyū hints at the answer in his signature, which immediately follows the poem and suggests that the artist prepared this work for a longtime patron.	白雲紅樹 (Hakuun kōju) Title: White Clouds and Crimson Trees Artist: Tanomura Chokunyū 田能村直入 (Japanese, 1814–1907) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: 1888 Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 58 3/8 × 20 in.

845153.jpg	Women Carrying Pots for the Tsukuma Festival	After Katsushika Hokusai 葛飾北斎	Japanese	ca. early 1880s	At first glance, this work showing two elegantly dressed women appears to be a deluxe painting on silk by the renowned artist Katsushika Hokusai, but microscopic inspection and scientific analysis of the pigment reveals that it is rather a sophisticated facsimile created partly by woodblock printing and partly by painting by hand. Some of the pigments used to color the kimono were not invented until over two decades after Hokusai died in 1849, so it would have been impossible for the master to have supervised the production of these works, even though obviously the technology for creating meticulous outlines (that replicate brush-drawn lines) already existed in the Edo period. A handful of other Hokusai paintings are known to have been reproduced using the same reproductive technology.This facsimile was based on an original meticulously colored painting on silk that represents the epitome of Hokusai’s bijinga (“paintings of beautiful women”), dating to around 1806 or 1807, when he was moving away from the depiction of svelte and delicate feminine beauty of his Sōri period (when he styled himself “Hokusai Sōri”) to a more sensuous portrayal of women.Two women here, one with two iron cooking pots on her head, the other carrying one in her left hand, are no doubt on their way to participate in the Tsukuma Festival (Tsukuma matsuri 筑摩祭) held in the early summer at the Shinto shrine of that name in Maihara near Lake Biwa, to the northeast of Kyoto. It is also referred to the Cooking Pot Festival (Nabe Matsuri) by locals.According to custom, the number of pots a women places on her head is supposed to correspond to the number of men she has had relationships with (though popular literature and humorous senryū poetry of Hokusai’s day openly spoofed the idea that pots would fall off the heads of women who lied about the number of men they had been involved with). There is also a two-panel screen treating the same theme by Hokusai dating to around 1799 to 1801 in the Freer Gallery Collection (F1904.177).	筑摩祭・鍋被り美人図 (Tsukuma matsuri, Nabe kaburi bijin zu) Title: Women Carrying Pots for the Tsukuma Festival Artist: After Katsushika Hokusai 葛飾北斎 (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: ca. early 1880s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; partly woodblock printed, partly painted in ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 33 9/16 × 12 3/8 in.

About a third of the images captures people—mostly women—of all walks of life enjoying outdoor excursions, activities of the Yoshiwara pleasure quarters, or annual festivities across the four seasons. Yet, central to the set, and in many ways the most interesting and instructive images, are the depictions of women and men busy at occupations that once defined Japan before modernization encroached: carving religious sculptures in stone and wood; constructing homes and temples according to traditional methods; dyeing and embroidering textiles; mounting paintings with silk borders.	豊原国周筆 当世庶民風俗画帖 Title: Artisans, Beauties, and Annual Events Artist: Toyohara Kunichika (Japanese, 1835–1900) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: 1874 Culture: Japan Medium: Thirty paintings mounted as an accordion album; ink, color, gold and gold flecks on silk Dimensions: Image (each): 11 7/8 × 13 1/8 in.

While the cranes were meticulously brushed in ink and light color, the background was rendered in atmospheric monochrome. The painter executed the bamboo and grasses in smooth lines with a fine brush while handling the rocks with expressive strokes and bold ink washes, conveying the overall effect of the tranquil evening when the moon is full but partially obscured by a stand of bamboo.Tanomura Chikuden (1777–1835) was a Nanga painter who had close connections with scholars and painters in Kyoto. He was inspired by literati masters of the Yuan dynasty and compiled painting treatises that set the theoretical foundation for literati painting in Japan.

A quatrain of Chinese verse, composed and fluently brushed in cursive and semicursive scripts by the celebrated Confucian scholar Rai San’yō, praises the peonies:洛水春風常掩關 不從姚魏酔雕欄 秋燈半壁高齋夜 却白霜縑看牡丹As spring breezes reach the capital’s river, my gate remains shut,and I do not become drunk and lean on balustrades to admire peonies of the houses of Yao and Wei.Rather, on this autumn night, when a lamp lights up half of my study,I prefer to gaze quietly upon these painted peonies on the frost-white silk.—Trans.

853220.jpg	Demons and Monsters	Takai Kōzan 高井鴻山	Japanese	ca. 1870s	This bizarre composition, rapidly brushed as if rendered unconsciously, or as if in a trance, captures the appearance of some twenty demons and ghosts in the foreground, with a more conventional scene of a scholar in a hut in the mountains in the background. The artist Takai Kōzan revealed that such paintings he created from the 1870s on, were responding to the hallucinations of demons appearing one after another whenever he closed his eyes to rest or sleep. Though formally trained and skilled in various styles of traditional Japanese painting, from the 1870s on until his death, Kōzan focused almost exclusively on paintings of ghosts and demons, The artist was no doubt subconsciously tapping into the anxiety of the times, when the Shogunate was about to lose power, and the country was opening up to the West, and members of elite society, as Kōzan was, felt threatened that the established societal hierarchies were being challenged.Born into a conspicuously wealthy sake-brewing and farming family in Obuse, in present-day Nagano Prefecture, Kōzan studied calligraphy, painting, poetry, and neo-Confucian philosophy with leading masters in both Kyoto and Edo. He succeeded to the family business in 1840, but apparently had little aptitude or interest in business management and preferred to devote himself to practicing Zen Buddhism and cultivating a wide network of intellectuals and artistic friends, including most notably the famous painter and print designer Katsushika Hokusai. He became a student of Hokusai, and hundreds of drawings the master created as study models for his pupil still survive. Because of his family’s great wealth and connections, Kōzan eventually was married into the family of the Shogun, which allowed him to further broaden his political and artistic networks. Among his most famous works are meticulous bird-and-flower paintings for the ceilings of festival floats that were collaboratively executed with Hokusai when the master, under the generous patronage of Kōzan, was staying in Obuse, A museum dedicated to preserving his Edo period home and his artistic output remains in Obuse, and a former director of that museum authenticated this work.	高井鴻山筆 妖怪図 Title: Demons and Monsters Artist: Takai Kōzan 高井鴻山 (Japanese, 1806–1883) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: ca. 1870s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; Dimensions: Image: 51 15/16 × 26 3/8 in.

853224.jpg	The Night Parade of One Hundred Demons	Tachibana Gadō 橘雅堂	Japanese	1892	In this handscroll, rendered in lively, almost cartoonish brushwork, a parade of demons makes its way from right to left in this horizontal composition. The monstrous but humorous-looking creatures appear in all shapes and sizes, some taking on rather grotesque human features while others resemble animals, birds, or demonic creatures from Buddhist hell paintings. Others represent household utensils, personal accessories like umbrellas, musical instruments or ritual objects that have come to life. The imagery is based on ancient legends about demons and goblins who parade by night through the streets and even the mansions of the old capital city (Kyoto), until the coming of dawn causes them to return to their otherworldly realm. These beliefs combined with folktales claiming that worn out household utensils could be transformed into demons to plague mankind at night.Scrolls such as this are variations on the Night Parade of One Hundred Demons that can be traced back to sixteenth-century handscroll version of the theme in the collection of the Shinjuan temple of the Daitokuji temple complex in Kyoto. Another, earlier handscroll version of similar imagery by Mochizuki Gyokusen (1692–1755) is also in The Met’s Collection (2018.853.22). This handscroll very well might have been inspired by Kawanabe Kyōsai’s immensely popular illustrated book Kyōsai’s Pictures of One Hundred Demons (Kyōsai Hyakki gadan) published in 1890 (2016.751.1).

890793.jpg	The Hell Courtesan	Utagawa Kunisada II	Japanese	late 1850s	This dazzling, nearly life-size, portrayal of a courtesan commands our attention because of the sumptuously patterned robes showing gory scenes of the Buddhist hell, presided over by Enma-ō, a wrathful god in Buddhism who judges the dead and presides as the King of Hell. Seated on throne, he is surrounded by seven of his judges while he reviews and records the misdeeds of the recently deceased, some of whom are prostrated in terror before him. Surrounding the central image of King Enma’s court are gory scenes of punishments of hell with demons presiding over sinners being variously tortured, burnt, and boiled.The subject is a woman of medieval times in Japan who worked in the Takasu district of Osaka and who was known as the Hell Courtesan, (Jigoku Dayū). Jigoku, literally “hell,” was also a term referring to unlicensed courtesans, while tayū (read dayū in combination with jigoku) was the term for the highest-ranking courtesan. In this portrayal, the woman’s high status is recognizable through her ornate hair adornments and luxurious, layered garments. Jigoku is said to have achieved redemption through an encounter with the fifteenth-century Zen monk Ikkyū (1394–1481), son of an emperor and forty-seventh abbot of the great Rinzai Zen temple Daitokuji in Kyoto. Although one of most venerable monks in the history of medieval Buddhism, Ikkyū was notorious for pursuing the path of enlightenment while enjoying the sensual pleasures of drink and cavorting with prostitutes. He mocked the hypocrisy of other monks who adopted a holier-than-thou attitude. According to legend, on his first encounter with Jigoku, he composed the opening stanza of a linked verse (renga):Kikishi yorimite osoroshikiJigoku kanaThough I had heardall about “Hell,”seeing the real thing—more daunting still!The Hell Courtesan's beauty was osoroshiki, which can mean “frightening.” as in the case of the Buddhist hell, or “daunting,” to describe the attractions of this femme fatale. Jigoku, a woman of many talents, immediately improvised the final stanza:Iki-kuru hito moochizarameyawaEven the living who draw nearcannot but fall into the abyss!(Trans. John T. Carpenter)By cleverly alluding to men who are ensnared by the beauty of courtesans, Jigoku revealed herself already enlightened in a worldly sense, and Monk Ikkyū was to direct her on the path to spiritual redemption. The apocryphal story was updated by the popular writer and ukiyo-e artist Santo Kyōden (Kitao Masanobu, 1761–1816) in Stories of drunken enlightenment in Japan (Honchō suibodai zenden), illustrated by Utagawa Toyokuni and published in 1809. This book inspired numerous nineteenth-century paintings of the Hell Courtesan including by prominent artists Kuniyoshi, Kunichika, and at the fin-de-siecle, by Kawanabe Kyōsai. The story was even more widely popularized when the play Ikkyū’s Tale of Hell (Ikkyū jigoku banashi) by the leading Kabuki dramatist, Kawatake Mokuami (1816–1893), was performed at the Ichimura theater in Tokyo in 1865. Actor prints commemorating the play, including one by Kunisada II, circulated widely. In the Kabuki version of events, Ikkyū enters a brothel and meets the courtesan Jigoku. As he dances with women in the brothel Jikoku peeps from behind a screen and to her astonishment sees that Ikkyū’s voluptuous companions have shriveled to their bare bones. The vision of dancing skeletons vanishes when she rejoins the group, but still viewers were reminded of the underlying Buddhist truth that beneath even the most glamorous facade lurks inevitable old age and death. In the play, Jigoku finds enlightenment with this graphic demonstration of human impermanence.	二代歌川国貞筆 地獄太夫図 Title: The Hell Courtesan Artist: Utagawa Kunisada II (Japanese, 1823–1880) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: late 1850s Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink and color on silk Dimensions: Image: 65 in. × 39 3/4 in.

895417.jpg	White-Robed Willow Kannon	Suzuki Shūitsu 鈴木守一	Japanese	mid- to late 19th century	A single sheet of silk was painted and inscribed by Shūitsu to appear as a normal hanging scroll, depicting White-Robed (Byaku-e) Kannon descending on a cloud bank. Moreover, the willow branch in his right hand, and the vase in his left also identify this deity as a manifestation of Willow (Yōryū) Kannon. The willow branch is believed to ward off evil and illness, while the vase contains a nectar with healing powers. The outer white cape, rendered with compulsive lacelike web of fine lines in gofun (shell pigment), suggests an otherworldly aura.All the “pieces” of what at first glance appears to be a silk mounting, however, including the fūtai (vertical flaps at the top center of a Japanese hanging scroll) are painted using a convention called “painted mounting” (kakibyōsō). The large white lotus flower from a distance appears to be part of a fabric mounting, but it is a trompe-l’oeil painting of the variety that artists of the Edo Rinpa school of the early nineteenth century had made a specialty. The middle indigo “border” is a transcription in gold paint in Shūitsu’s own hand of the Kannon chapter of the Lotus Sutra. See a similar rendering of the sutra passage from the Kannon-kyō on a painting of White-Robed Kannon by Kiitsu’s Rinpa predecessor Sakai Hōitsu (1761–1829) in The Met’s collection (2017.293). All the details of the composition here are meticulously executed, especially impressive is the degree of detail: the nectar in the glass vase that Kannon holds in his left hand, for example, is painted in a very light application of shimmery, translucent mica; the cloud on which Kannon descends is painted using extremely light ink wash and several applications of light gold wash while taking advantage of the unmarked silk; the halo and other motifs painted in gold are slightly raised, suggesting that Shūitsu applied the gold on top of shell white.Shūitsu, oldest son and artistic heir of Edo Rinpa painter Suzuki Kiitsu (1796–1858), demonstrates how he had mastered the techniques of both floral painting and iconographic paintings produced by his father, who had earlier apprenticed and then collaborated closely with Sakai Hōitsu, who had founded the Edo Rinpa school based on the models of eighteenth-century master Ogata Kōrin.The work is stored in a paulownia wood box inscribed by the artist himself, referring to the work as White-Robed Willow Kanzeon (Byaku-e Yōryū Kanzeon zu 白衣楊柳觀世音図), using the more formal rendering of the bodhisattva’s name, Kanzeon (Chinese: Guanshiyin), which means “[The One Who] Perceives the Sounds of the World.”	白衣楊柳観音図 (Byaku-e Yōryū Kannon zu) Title: White-Robed Willow Kannon Artist: Suzuki Shūitsu 鈴木守一 (Japanese, 1823–1889) Period: Edo (1615–1868) or Meiji (1868–1912) period Date: mid- to late 19th century Culture: Japan Medium: Hanging scroll; ink, color, gold, and silver on silk Dimensions: Image (including painted mounting (kakibyōsō)): 70 1/4 × 16 7/16 in.

The lady cleans her teeth with a split-bamboo toothbrush. Her cotton sleeping robe slips off one shoulder, and a few strands of her hair have come loose, suggesting that she is only half awake. The large morning-glory flowers, known as asagao (literally, "morning faces"), in the pot behind her on the right, are cleverly associated with the portrait.The excellence of the technique of this print is demonstrated in the fine lines representing the woman's hair, and reveals Yoshitoshi's genius for sensitive and sophisticated compositions.

72828.jpg	Fudō Myōō Threatening a Novice	Tsukioka Yoshitoshi	Japanese	1885	A legend about Abbot Yūten (1637–1718) of Zōjōji Temple tells how, as a novice, he prayed for Fudō Myōō’s aid to become a wise monk. He then dreamed that the statue of Fudō leaped down from its pedestal and made him swallow one of his swords; upon waking, he became an excellent cleric. In this scene, Fudō aims his sword at Yūten while the deity’s attendants witness his magical power. Tsukioka Yoshitoshi was one of the great innovators of Meiji ukiyo-e; here, his triptych features an airy, theatrical type of composition associated with his late style, with a hint of the violence that characterized many of his earlier works.	月岡芳年筆 不動明王∙祐天上人図 Title: Fudō Myōō Threatening a Novice Artist: Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (Japanese, 1839–1892) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: 1885 Culture: Japan Medium: Triptych of woodblock prints; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Overall (a): 14 3/4 x 10 in.

73416.jpg	Foreigners in the Drawing Room of Foreign Merchant's House in Yokohama	Utagawa (Gountei) Sadahide	Japanese	9th month, 1861	The unexpected arrival of the American Commodore Matthew Perry (1794—1858) in Tokyo in 1853 truly astonished the Japanese people, who had been isolated from the rest of the world for more than 200 years, since the national seclusion act of 1639. Rapidly following Perry's visit, the nation's doors opened to the West, the feudal government of the shoguns collapsed, and the modern age was ushered in.Foreigners visiting Tokyo from "the five nations"—England, the Netherlands, France, Russia, and the United States—were restricted to living in Yokohama, a port city on Tokyo Bay. Their physical appearance, apparel, and ways of life were subjected to intense scrutiny and became the popular theme for so-called Yokohama prints. In this imaginary scene, a Western merchant's family relaxes in a European-style residence. Western ships like the ones that frequented Tokyo Bay can be glimpsed through the windows.

73569.jpg	Defeat of the Mongols in the Western Sea	Utagawa (Gountei) Sadahide	Japanese	1863	Described at upper right in a text by journalist Sansantei Arindo (Jōno Saigiku; 1832–1902), this triptych imagines the destruction of Chinese Yuan-dynasty forces by typhoon after their attempted sea invasions in the late thirteenth century. Japanese forces gather on the beach holding banners, one of which features a red circle on a white ground with the Buddhist mantra “Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō” (Glory to the Lotus Sutra).

Two children, Hinadori and Koganosuke, of rival court families, are held hostage under orders from the tyrant Soga no Iruka to ensure their families do not revolt. The children fall in love, but rather than create conflicts for their families they each vow to die by suicide. When the parents learn of their plans, they resolve to cooperate to overthrow Iruka. Here Koganosuke and his father Kiyozumi are shown; a companion sheet on the left would have shown Hinadori and her mother Sadaka.	「大判事清澄 坂東三津五郎」（三代）・「久我之助 嵐小六」（四代） Title: Bandō Mitsugorō III as Daihanji Kiyozumi and Arashi Koroku IV as Koganosuke Artist: Shunkōsai Hokushū 春好斎北洲 (Japanese, active 1808–32) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1821 Culture: Japan Medium: Right sheet of a diptych of woodblock prints (nishiki-e); ink and color on paper; vertical ōban Dimensions: Image: 15 × 10 in.

Fireworks illuminate a starry night sky over the Tenma Bridge, probably for the Tenjin Festival held annually on the twenty-fifth day of the seventh month. Spectators on the banks and in riverboats enliven the scene. The actors hold summer fans and smoking paraphernalia, and a puppy plays with a sandal of Nakamura Tomozō on the far left.

It is named after the Tenpō era, when it was created, and it was intended to replicate the appearance of the arched tortoise-shell shape of Mount Hōrai of East Asian lore, home to Daoist immortals. After a lighthouse was erected and trees were planted, officials invited performers to visit, in order to attract crowds of people who would help tamp down the loose soil. In this idealized rendering, famous Osaka actors of the day are shown arriving with members of their fan clubs, and enjoying refreshments in wayside stands.	「浪花天保山風景」 Title: “View of Mount Tenpō in Osaka” (Naniwa Tempōzan fukei) Artist: Hasegawa Sadamasu 長谷川貞升 (Japanese, active 1830s–40s) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1836 Culture: Japan Medium: Tetraptych of woodblock prints (nishiki-e); vertical ōban Dimensions: Image (each): 14 1/8 × 10 in.

77885.jpg	Courtier and Lady with a Young Woman Poling a Boat	Kubo Shunman	Japanese	1796	This scene evokes the famous scene from Chapter 51, “A Boat Cast Away” (Ukifune), of the The Tale of Genji. The setting is the New Year, the beginning of spring in the lunar calendar, when the plum trees are about to burst into bloom, the warbler is poised to sing its first song (hatsune) of the year, and pine saplings—ready to be plucked—for the Ne no hi (First Day of the Rat) ceremony adorn the shores of a winding stream. At a tumultuous point in her life Ukifune finds herself falling in love with competing suitors, Kaoru and Niou. The far-and-away most commonly depicted scene set a bit later in spring after a heavy snowfall when the moon is in the morning sky and Niou joins Ukifune for boat ride on the Uji river to the Isle of Oranges (Tachibana no kojima) accompanied, according to the tale, by her maid and a boatman. In most depictions, however, the maid and boatman are omitted from the scene to focus on the lovers. Here a young maiden with flowing hair poles the boat. The kyōka (witty thirty-one-syllable poems) accompanying the illustration are not connected to The Tale of Genji in any way whatsoever, but are rather generic New Year’s greetings, and a surimono (privately commissioned print) like this would have circulated among members of a literary salon. Yet, even though the poems have no explicit references the Tale, the setting of the Ukifune chapter at the New Year, the beginning of spring, allows the poetic associations and imagery to provide the setting for a New Year’s greeting card. One phrase in the middle of the third poem from the right includes the phrase “niou ume ga ka,” “the scent the plum is fragrant . . . ,” but just that little reference was enough to trigger associations in the artist’s imagination with a scene of “fragrant” plum blossoms, not to mention the obvious coincidence that niou (to be fragrant) is a homonym for Niou, the courtier wooing Ukifune. The artist-poet Kubo Shunman (1757–1820) was clever at illustrating and animating such references. He was well versed in the classics and created various surimono series based on the classics such as the Tosa Diary (Tosa nikki) and Tales of Ise (Ise monogatari), among others. The head of the Bakurō poetry group, Hajintei (Tsumuri no) Hikari (1754–1796), whose poem is on the far left, the place of honor, was on close terms with Shunman, who was a skilled poet as well, and would have negotiated with the artist over the design and fee	Title: Courtier and Lady with a Young Woman Poling a Boat Artist: Kubo Shunman (Japanese, 1757–1820) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1796 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print (surimono); ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 5 5/8 x 11 in.

The gifts are cotton hand towels (tenugui) that have been folded into miniature workmen’s coats, each decorated with the three concentric squares (mimasu) of his family crest and the words Ichikawa and Kiba (a reference to the actor’s home in Fukagawa). It is likely that this surimono was designed while Danjūrō was performing in Osaka in 1830.	歌川国貞画 浪花土産を作る七代目市川団十郎 Title: Ichikawa Danjūrō VII Preparing New Year's Gifts Artist: Utagawa Kunisada (Japanese, 1786–1864) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1830 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print (surimono); ink, color and metallic pigments on paper; shikishiban Dimensions: Image: 8 1/4 × 7 1/4 in.

633305.jpg	Courtesan with Branch of Plum Blossoms	Totoya Hokkei	Japanese	1835	A high-ranking courtesan is shown preparing a flower arrangement from a bough of cherry blossoms, a symbol of the arrival of New Year and spring in the lunar calendar. She gazes back to admire a hanging scroll painting of a goat in the alcove, indicating that his surimono (privately published woodblock print) was created to celebrate spring of the year of the goat—1835 in this case. The obi sash, embossed with a fan emblem of the poetry group that printed this, appears to be printed in Prussian blue, a pigment that was used extensively in woodblock prints from around 1829 onwards. Three kyōka (31-syllable witty verse) on vernal themes accompany the image. The poem on the left, the position of honor, is by the kyōka master Yayoian Hinamaru II. The print is signed “Aoigaoka rōjin,” or “Old Man Aoigaoka.” Though at first we thought that this might refer to Aoigaoka Keisai, a pupil of Totoya Hokkei, who also used this name, research shows that this must refer to the master not the pupil. Hokkei’s gō (style name) was Aoigaoka, and in 1836 used this signature on another print, Furthermore, his gravestone is engraved with his name as “Aoigaoka Rōjin Hokkei kun no haka” (The Tomb of Master Hokkei, Old Man Aoigaoka).

712976.jpg	Fireworks at Ikenohata	Kobayashi Kiyochika	Japanese	1881 (Meiji 14)	On a summer evening, along Shinobazu Pond in the Ikenohata district in northeastern Tokyo, crowds of people—visible only in dark silhouette—watch fireworks explode in the distance. The spectators stand beneath a string of brightly lit lanterns, while a couple of children have climbed a tree to get a better view. The outlines of Benten Shrine, in the middle of Shinobazu Pond, can be seen on the right horizon while the lighted windows and lanterns illuminated on the far shore cast their shimmering reflections on the water. The print artist Kobayashi Kiyochika became famous for these “light ray pictures” (kōsenga) that explored the play of light against darkness. Often depicting scenes illuminated by gas lamps that were becoming so prevalent in the city, Kiyochika discovered the profound world of darkness and shadows that recalled the Edo of his childhood. Between 1876 and 1881, during an age of rapid modernization, Kiyochika created a series of prints capturing scenes of famous locales in Tokyo. Usually print artists of this time, including Kiyochika as well, focused on the aspects of the city that were changing, and created colorful and complex compositions exalting Western style architecture and technology, Japanese aristocrats in European outfits, or scenes of Japan soldiers in battles in Russia or China. Kiyochika in this set of prints, however, seemed intent on holding onto something that was being lost in modern Japan. For instance, ukiyo-e artists of the Edo period (1618–1868) often depicted firework celebrations, and it became associated with views of the old city, and this print recalls such earlier examples. Kiyochika achieved renown for the way that he captured the effects of light and dark in his nocturnal cityscapes. He often depicted scenes illuminated by gas lamps that were becoming so prevalent in the city, while here the lighting effects are created by lanterns illuminated by candles, and the fireworks exploding in the night sky. His prints have been called “light ray pictures” (kōsenga) because of this preoccupation with the play of light against darkness. The scholar Maeda Ai observed, “it may seem a paradoxical way to put it, but what Kiyochika discovered anew under the influence of the brightness of gaslight was precisely the profound darkness and deep shadows of Edo space that enveloped the domain of ‘civilization’.” (“The Light and Darkness of Kiyochika,” in Literature in Urban Space, Chikuma Shobō, 1982) By focusing on the new technology of light, the artist discovered a world of shadows that recalled for him the Edo of his childhood.	「池の端花火」 Title: Fireworks at Ikenohata Artist: Kobayashi Kiyochika (Japanese, 1847–1915) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: 1881 (Meiji 14) Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Image: 8 × 12 3/8 in.

749409.jpg	The Rakan Handaka Sonja with Dragon	Utagawa Hiroshige	Japanese	1820 ( year of the dragon)	This woodblock print design by the highly esteemed artist Utagawa Hiroshige shows a dragon magically emanating from the alms bowl of an arhat (disciple of Buddha) depicted in a hanging scroll. It is an extremely rare surviving example of a surimono, or privately published woodblock print, from early in Hiroshige’s career. Surimono like this one were often commissioned by poetry groups or individual poets—from the late eighteenth to early nineteenth century—as a form of New Year’s greeting card. This print celebrated spring of the year of the dragon, 1820. To our knowledge, only two other impressions of this print survive, and it is a rarity among rarities from the corpus of the young Hiroshige, still in his early twenties when he created this. The rakan Handaka Sonja (Sanskrit: Arhat Panthaka) is one of the sixteen disciples of Buddha often depicted together. Whether in paintings or netsuke carving he is usually shown accompanied by his pet dragon which he keeps in a bowl (as here) or in a gourd.

842154.jpg	Sometsuke Sencha Teapot and Cups	Yamada Hōgyoku 山田抱玉	Japanese	1830s	This fan-shaped woodcut, printed entirely in blue, presents an elegant still life of a sometsuke blue-and-white ceramic teapot and a couple of cups—used to imbibe Chinese-style sencha tea—against a saturated, dark toned azure background. This little print by Yamada Hōgyoku, an artist trained in the Rinpa school, encapsulates the huge impact created by the more widespread use of the imported pigment Prussian blue in woodblock prints beginning around 1830.On the front of the teapot accompanying the design of chrysanthemums is a Chinese verse couplet reading: 九日東籬菊 三秋香更佳On the ninth day, chrysanthemumsby the eastern fence that blossom in the autumn seasonare ever more fragrant. (Trans. John T. Carpenter) “Ninth day” 九日 here refers to the Double Ninth or Chongyang (Japanese: Chōyō) Festival, traditionally held on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month. One activity associated with the festival is ascending a height, usually a mountain or a tower, to symbolically avoid getting sick from an epidemic. The use of the phrase “by the eastern fence” also immediately calls to mind a line from the famous poem by the Chinese recluse-poet Tao Yuanming (Tao Qian, 365?–427) that would have been familiar to all well-read Japanese of the day.	染付煎茶器団扇絵 Title: Sometsuke Sencha Teapot and Cups Artist: Yamada Hōgyoku 山田抱玉 (Japanese, active 1820s–1840s) Period: Edo period (1615-1868) Date: 1830s Culture: Japan Medium: Blue-colored woodblock print (aizuri-e); ink and color on paper; fan print (uchiwa-e) on horizontal aiban sheet Dimensions: Image: approx. 9 × 11 1/2 in.

853241.jpg	Chōmeiji Temple (Chōmeiji), from the series Miracles of Kannon	Utagawa Hiroshige II 二代目歌川広重	Japanese	1859	Chōmeiji Temple, situated on a hill overlooking Lake Biwa just east of Kyoto, and a popular destination on the Kannon pilgrimage route, is pictorialized in the upper half of this woodblock print by Hiroshige II. The subtitle of the print states that Chōmeiji is the thirty-first stop on the Kannon Pilgrimage of the Western Provinces (Saikoku junrei). The main hall that enshrines the Shō Kannon statue and the five-story pagoda, still standing, are shown in the panoramic view.Below, designed by Kunisada, is a depiction of the apocryphal episode from the temple history based on an episode in the Illustrated Teachings of the Kannon Sutra in Japanese (Kannon-kyō wakun-zue), by Mantei Oga—abridged in the accompanying text here. It shows fishermen recovering the body of Sahara Tōjūrō 佐原藤十郎, who had committed suicide because he could not pay off family debts. But he was found and saved by fisherman who saw his drifting body in the water of Lake Biwa, near the temple. The bodhisattva Kannon had taken mercy on him and revived him, because of the deep faith in Buddhism previously held by his parents when they were still alive. To show his appreciation, Tōjūrō became a pupil of a monk from Chōmeiji and commissioned a statue of Kannon in his village.Coincidentally, The Met owns a rare example of Chōmeiji pilgrimage mandala, created to raise funds for its rebuilding after the entire temple complex was leveled by fire in 1516 during warfare that affected the whole Kyoto area (2016.517).	観音霊験記 長命寺 Title: Chōmeiji Temple (Chōmeiji), from the series Miracles of Kannon Artist: Utagawa Hiroshige II 二代目歌川広重 (Japanese, 1826–1869) (upper) Artist: Utagawa Kunisada (Toyokuni III) 歌川国貞(三代歌川豊国) (Japanese, 1786–1864) (lower) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1859 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print (nishiki-e); ink and color on paper Dimensions: Vertical ōban; image: 13 1/2 × 9 1/4 in.

857956.jpg	Mother and her Children in Front of a Freestanding Screen of a Chinese Lion	Kitagawa Utamaro 喜多川歌麿	Japanese	1786	In this domestic scene, an oversize freestanding screen features a “Chinese lion” (karajishi), monstrous in size but completely lacking in ferocity, scratches its head with its hind paw while holding a large white peony in its mouth. The picture-within-a-picture was executed in bold, thick ink outline strokes by Toriyama Sekien, a Kano trained artist. The aristocratic lady and her two children reacting in awe to the dynamic painting of a mythological beast were created by Sekien’s most famous pupil—the ukiyo-e print artist Kitagawa Utamaro, renowned for his images of beautiful women of the demimonde. Partly hidden behind the screen to the right, a wooden bucket holds branches of cherry blossoms, created by Toriyama Sekichūjo, a female pupil of Sekien.Seikien’s playful depiction of a Chinese lion likely alludes to a famous legend about a Japanese monk journeying to China to seek enlightenment who has a miraculous vision of a lion, associated with the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, Manjusri, frolicking in a field of peonies. Delineated in the Kano style, the image may also allude to Sekien’s role as a revered master able to transmit the secret teachings of ink painting to followers like Utamaro and Sekichūjo. Whatever the rationale, the surimono commemorates Sekien’s turning seventy-five, and celebrates a special connection between the master and two of his pupils.The setting is luxurious, suggesting that the work was made at the behest of a wealthy patron, probably on behalf of the elderly artist Sekien. The mother—dressed in elegant courtly garb and wearing her hair in long, flowing tresses—comforts her little son and his older brother as they react with fear to the oversize picture of a lion, as if this fabulous beast had come to life. Depicted to the left of the freestanding screen is an inlaid lacquered table adorned with a table screen and a bronze vase holding peacock feathers. Beside it is a low lacquered desk with a sheaf of writing paper held in place by a rabbit-shaped paperweight. On the far right, a wooden bucket behind the screen holds branches of cherry blossoms, indicating the season is late spring.This exceedingly rare surimono (privately published woodblock print) to my knowledge is the only surviving impression and documents a remarkable collaboration between Sekien and two of his pupils who eventually moved beyond the traditional painting styles of the Kano school to distinguish themselves in the Ukiyo-e school. This surimono may be a considered a certificate of transmission of artistic teachings between generations. The master Sekien had been a dedicated student of Gyokuen Chikanobu, an adherent of the conservative Kano school in Edo of eighteenth century, but who, through producing designs for printed editions of popular literature and ghost stories, developed close links with Ukiyo-e school artists and publishers. Important also, were the connections that both Sekien and Utamaro would have to poets in popular poetry circles—both 17-syllable haikai and 31-syllable witty kyōka verse—of the late nineteenth century. That this particular impression once belonged to poet, essayist, and great literary arbiter Ōta Nanpo (Shōkusanjin), as demonstrated by the collector’s seal, further attests to remarkable cultural networking this print represents	唐獅子図の衝立 Title: Mother and her Children in Front of a Freestanding Screen of a Chinese Lion Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro 喜多川歌麿 (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Artist: Toriyama Sekien 鳥山石燕 (Japanese, 1712–1788) Artist: Toriyama Sekichūjo 鳥山石仲女 (Japanese, born 1763–?)

57818.jpg	Mountain Teahouse, from The Mist of of Sandara (Kyōka Sandara-kasumi) 狂歌さむたらかすみ			1798	This volume is an anthology of kyōka verses selected by the poet Sandara and privately published by the Kasumi poetry club in 1798. It includes one print each by Hokusai, Kitao Shigemasa (1739–1820), and Hasegawa Settan (1778–1843). The scene by Hokusai depicts daily life in a rural setting—a woodcarver at work, several female assistants, and a traveler resting—with a view of Mount Fuji in the background.A light and elegant touch typifies Hokusai's work of the Sōri period, early in his career. His signature reads Hokusai Sōri.	狂歌さむたらかすみKyōka Sandara-kasumi Title: Mountain Teahouse, from The Mist of of Sandara (Kyōka Sandara-kasumi) 狂歌さむたらかすみ Artist: Katsushika Hokusai 葛飾北斎 (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Artist: Hasegawa Settan 長谷川雪旦 (Japanese, 1778–1843) Artist: Kitao Shigemasa 北尾重政 (Japanese, 1739–1820) Calligrapher: Nagasawa Kosai Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1798 Culture: Japan Medium: Polychrome woodblock print in an album; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 8 3/4 × 6 1/4 × 3/8 in.

36490.jpg	South Wind, Clear Sky (Gaifū kaisei), also known as Red Fuji, from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei)	Katsushika Hokusai	Japanese	ca. 1830–32	Hokusai's "Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji" is justly celebrated as one of the world's greatest series of images of various conditions and vantage points of a particular place, in this case, the mountain synonymous with Japan. Juxtaposed here with the clear brilliant calm of "South Wind, Clear Sky" (the "Red Fuji"), the Storm Below Fuji reveals the expressive range and power of Hokusai's vision. Forky across the inky base, a bolt of white lightning dramatizes the sudden change from a cloud filled summer sky to the murky violence that obscures all below Fuji's magnificent cone.This series created such a sensation that the publisher Eijudo expanded the original conception to eventually include forty-six prints in this series. Another version pulled from the same block includes a line of trees, dimly visible in the rain below the mountain, but this print more effectively implies the awesome moment of the summer storm by eliminating this explicit depiction of rain.This series is noted for its particular blue color, called "Berlin indigo" (bero-ai), a pigment newly introduced by Dutch merchants.	「富嶽三十六景 凱風快晴」 Title: South Wind, Clear Sky (Gaifū kaisei), also known as Red Fuji, from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei) Artist: Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1830–32 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 9 5/8 x 14 in.

36620.jpg	Modern Versions of the twenty-four Paragons of Filial Piety: Guo Zhu	Isoda Koryūsai	Japanese	ca. 1770	As his young wife watches raptly, a young man is taking boiling water with a bamboo ladle from an iron tea cauldron in a square hearth set into the tatami mat floor. Behind him a Chinese-style painting of a bird in bamboo is hung before a bird-shaped incense burner in the tokonoma alcove. This scene of domestic tranquility focused on the cauldron and other utensils of the formal tea ceremony (chanoyu) is in fact a witty parody of one of the moralizing tales propagated in Confucianism, the official ideology of the Tokugawa shogunate. Guo Zhu, said to have lived in the second century A.D. in China, was so devoted to his aged mother that, finding himself unable to support his entire family, he persuaded his wife that they should bury their infant son to be able to feed her. As he was digging the grave, he uncovered a cauldron of gold, a just reward which saved him from a painful, extreme exercise of his filial piety. Such an urbane twist on a traditional theme is typical of the wit of Ukiyo artists and their Edo patrons, who chafed under the rigid morality espoused by the Shogunate. Koryūsai adopted the doll-like figures of his teacher Harunobu, adding a fresh robustness that prefigures the more realistic representations of the 1780s. The darkened mottling on the orange color is the result of oxidation of red lead, an effect sometimes used intentionally for architectural elements.

The scenes are of sunset, the cool of twilight, and an evening rain. This image displays an appreciation of ordinary aspects of daily life, capturing the moment that the couple sets out in the rain, he tucks up his robe, and she prepares to open her umbrella.Utamaro, a prolific ukiyo-e artist, was fascinated by themes of daily life as well as by beautiful women.

36623.jpg	Woman Relaxing after Her Bath	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	1790s	Utamaro was the first artist to use okubi-e, the large-head portrait, to depict women. This format allows him to focus solely on the facial features critical in conveying a woman's emotions, while the elimination of the background removes all narrative from the print. In this picture, Utamaro represent the bather as an icon; the robe, towel and slightly tousled hair become her symbols. Her refreshed mood is shown by her squinting eyes and slightly open mouth, as if she is sighing in relief. Unlike Harunobu, who focuses on color harmony, Utamaro uses only a few simple colors, so as not to disturb his concentration on the figure.

36626.jpg	A Young Woman Reading A Letter	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	1790s	In this print, from a series portraying women in different phases of romance, Utamaro captures a young woman at the moment she stops to comtemplate a letter. She extends her hands from her robe to hold this letter from her lover that perhaps suggests their next meeting. She lifts her head, opens her mouth slightly, and looks into the distance. The large-head portrait format effectively captures her complex emotion, agony perhaps.	歌撰恋之部 夜毎に逢恋 Title: A Young Woman Reading A Letter Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1790s Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 14 1/2 x 10 1/8 in.

In this triptych, he arranged a group of three figures in the foreground of each sheet and used Western perspective (uki-e) to draw our eyes to the seascape in the distance.

36708.jpg	Paulownia Trees at Akasaka in the Evening Rain	Utagawa Hiroshige II	Japanese	1859	Hiroshige II was the son-in-law and successor to his namesake, who died in 1858. This print was completed seven months after the elder artist's death as a replacement for his version of the same setting (plate 53 of One Hundred Famous Views of Edo), the original woodblocks for which may have been damaged or lost. This composition confirms that the younger artist adopted both his predecessors' formal and symbolic usage of the silhouette. Layers of silhouettes in the background allow the artist to suggest the dramatic upward sweep of the landscape. Like his master, Hiroshige II treats the background as a plane where the sharpness of the foreground trees and figures has suddenly given way to biomorphic silhouettes. The artist's free sense of color can be seen in his almost abstract application of green to suggest the foliage of the trees. The background can almost be read on a symbolic level as a metaphysical point of departure from the earthly to the transmundane.

36731.jpg	A Wren and Chrysanthemums	Utagawa Hiroshige	Japanese	ca. 1830	Intriguingly, the artist borrowed both his depiction of the wren (misosazai) and the accompanying kyōka (thirty-one-syllable witty verse) from the poetry book Myriad Birds (Momo chidori, ca. 1790), illustrated by Kitagawa Utamaro and published about four decades before. The poem is about falling in love with a high-ranked courtesan and was composed by Karagoromo Kisshū (1743–1802), a samurai-poet who was one of the pioneers of the kyōka revival in the late eighteenth century. 大鵬の 高き心の 君ゆへに うきみそさゝゐ よりもつかれず Taihō no takaki kokoro no kimi yue ni uki misosazai yori mo tsukarezu Since your ambition is as lofty as that of Taihōthe majestic bird of legendas a wren, even if I fall in love, I cannot hope to soar that high.—Trans.

37027.jpg	Okabe	Utagawa Hiroshige	Japanese	ca. 1842	Among the several series Hiroshige designed following the great success of his first Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō, one of the finest is that published in the early Kaei era (1848–1854), popularly known as the "Gyosho (Cursive style) Tōkaidō" after the calligraphic style of the titles. Here, the mountain pass at Okabe, the twenty-second station on the road in the mountains west of Suruga Bay is depicted in a style that might also be considered abbreviated. Brilliant colors predominate, reminiscent of depictions of this locale, Mount Utsu, by Rimpa artists based on an episode from Chapter 9 in the poetic classic Tales of Ise. Hiroshige replaced the ascetic wandering on the ivy-covered mountain pass of the Heian Period tale with the robust traveller of Edo who eagerly approaches a roadside tea house. There the proprietress, baby on her back, manages a bustling wayside business. A placard advertises the local speciality, Utsunoyama Dango, rice balls served with a sweet bean sauce, which can be seen hanging from the rafters, skewered on sticks or strung in circles. Today, these same local products are sold on the Tōkaidō railroad as the highspeed train whizzes by this once isolated, long famous mountain pass.	東海道五十三次之内 岡部 宇津の山之図 Title: Okabe Artist: Utagawa Hiroshige (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1797–1858 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1842 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 9 1/8 x 13 23/32 in.

37097.jpg	Matsukaze Murasame	Hishikawa Moronobu 菱川師宣	Japanese	ca. 1675–80	This print and its text present a wittily updated version of the two brine gatherers' tragic love for Yukihira, who was in exile at Suma. At the right he strolls arm in arm with the sisters Matsukaze and Murasame. Despite their droll aristocratic attire, the trio's deportment is that of pleasure-seeking youth in the bustling entertainment quarters of Edo. At the left the two women in contemporary garb who dip buckets are identified as seaweed gatherers ("shiokumi"), the name of a popular Kabuki dance that represented the immortal legend at the time. This print reflects Moronobu's origins as an illustrator of popular books in its humor as well as its compostion.

37099.jpg	Dekishima Hanya Seated on a Cherry Tree	Torii Kiyonobu I	Japanese	ca. 1700–05	Dekishima Hanya was a very popular Kabuki actor of female roles in the beginning of the eighteenth century. Here we see him seated on a cherry tree with his kamon or family crest prominently displayed on his shoulder and hovering above him. Although he is not depicted in the guise of a female character here, he is wearing a lavish woman's kimono. In his day, young men wore women's clothes as a sign of their outre fashion. Following this trend, Dekishima wears an elegant woman's kimono with a floral and rabbit pattern. His right sleeve, however, has slipped off his shoulder to reveal an inner garment with the dynamic design of a large swooping hawk. Kiyonobu skilfully manipulated the images of the rabbit of the outer garment which drapes Dekishima's legs and the hawk on the sleeve of the inner garment to transform the figure's body into the arena of a predator's attack on its prey. It was the compelling force of the "beauty and beast" imagery in prints such as this which, more than a century later, inspired Claude Monet to paint a portrait of his wife in a Japanese kimono embroidered with a ferocious warrior's grimacing face.The date of this work at the beginning of the eighteenth century is confirmed by the tan-ye technique of pirnt-making which Kiyonobu has used here. This technique is characterized by hand coloring with red lead.

37102.jpg	An Oiran Standing, a Pipe in Her right Hand, and Turning to Look Behind over Her Shoulder	Torii Kiyomasu I	Japanese	ca. 1705	The first ukiyo-e prints were conceived as paraphrases of ink drawings. The woodblock cutter gave exaggerated attention to duplicating the irregularities of the brush stroke, for instance, the variations in thickness of the calligraphic curves and the feathery quality at the point where the brush left the paper. However, in this translation from painting to the simplicity of the woodblock print, the freely-drawn line of the brush artist became more precise and robust in the physical process of incising hard wood. Additionally, the contrast between the soft, white paper and the heavy black calligraphic lines, the bold graphic patterning, and greater attention to the surface all contributed to a new aesthetic.Kiyomasu represents the vigorous style of the Torii school artist. This composition offers an outstanding example of the diverse appearance of line—the thick, vigorous calligraphic strokes that adorn the sleeve and outer robe in contrast to the delicate geometric lines that suggest the inner robe. The courtesan gestures with the full curve of the body, while her outer robe is depicted with a fluid, animated line and slashing strokes that emphasize the weight of the draping sleeve. Large sweeping lines are allowed full play in graceful acknowledgement of the Edo beauty.

37104.jpg	Kabuki Actors Nakamura Gentaro and Ikushima Shingoro	Torii Kiyomasu I	Japanese	ca. 1710	Torii artists dominated the production of prints of Kabuki actors. To enliven those done in ink, red and yellow pigments were often directly brushed onto the prints (tan-e) about the time of the Genroku and Shotoku eras (1688–1716). Colors were added within the printed outlines of the costumes. Vibrant, expressive ink lines convey a freedom of spirit and a sense of emotion. In a manner unique to the early ukiyo-e style, Kiyonobu and Kiyomasu animated robes with fluid lines, swirling patterns, and boldly designed motifs to suggest their wearers' vitality.

37114.jpg	The Actor Bando Hikosaburo 2nd as an Oiran in a Gauze Kimono, Standing, Tying Her Obi	Torii Kiyomitsu	Japanese	ca. 1764	As color began to transform the use of line, a new format emerged that also ushered in additional compositional possibilities. The pillar print, an elongated rectangle that refers to the traditional scroll, featured young women partially concealed from the viewer. Their allusiveness adds a certain mystery and allure to the subjects, whose preoccupations with the transaction of love letters and reflections on womanhood reinforce their introspection.The process of color printing also changed the relationship of parts to whole in the pictorial conception, as was noted in Masanobu's pioneering work. Kiyomitsu intensifies the new mode of color orchestration by intentionally cropping the figure, suggesting a scenario that may only be completed with the passage of time. This reference to temporality heralded a new narrative structure, one that characterized the prints of the next great generation of ukiyo-e artists, such as Harunobu and Utamaro.

37118.jpg	Visiting	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1769	The twelfth-century Mumyōzōshi (The Untitled Book), a book of literary criticism written by women, pronounced the legendary Komachi a love poet unequaled: "Although there have been many enamored of love who wrote poems, Ono no Komachi, beginning with her appearance, her good looks, manners, and personality, in every way she is considered the epitome (of the passionate woman poet)." The Komachi legend sparked the popular imagination and inspired tales (kajin setsuwa) and Noh plays for many generations. In the fourteenth century a series of seven plays about Komachi and her doomed lover Fukakusa were created as a part of the Kanze repertory. One of the seven, Kayoi Komachi, is a Noh play by Kan'ami (1333–1384) revised by his son, Zeami (1363–1443). The plays were adapted to Edo jorūri ballads and puppet theater as well as to the Kabuki stage. Besides being popular in theatrical settings, Komachi was a natural subject for prints: a classic persona easily assumed by the beautiful, literary courtesans inhabiting the ukiyo-e world.The bird design in the noren curtains behind the young women alludes to the imagery in the Komachi poem in the square cartouche:Akatsuki noshigi no hane kakimomo ha kakikimi ga konu yo wwaga zo kazu kazuAgitated like the wings of the snipe at dawn, beating and beating, on the night you do not come, endlessly beating.	風流七小町 Title: Visiting Artist: Suzuki Harunobu (Japanese, 1725–1770) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1769 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 25 31/32 x 4 1/4 in.

His graceful, willowy images of women remind us of the delicate beauties of Suzuki Harunobu (1725–1770). The halberd that the woman holds and the shape of the window behind the couple are Chinese and may suggest a parody (mitate) of a Chinese subject.

37123.jpg	Two Lovers	Hishikawa Moronobu 菱川師宣	Japanese	ca. 1675–80	Moronobu, the earliest ukiyo-e master, was trained in his family's textile business. He used his knowledge of fabric in the design of his prints, which were the first to explore the theme of beautiful women. He adapted a calligraphic style to black-and-white woodblocks, creating expression by manipulating line. This print, a leaf from an album of shunga, or erotica, shows Moronubu's ability to suggest human sensibilities through inanimate objects. Contrasting the curves of the costumes with the straight lines of the architectural setting, he portrays a woman and her lover, whose bodies—and robes—are beginning to intertwine. Behind them, seeming to float in space because of the artificially high viewpoint, is a cast-off uchikake (outer robe). The sleeves lie parallel, reinforcing the idea of the couple's intimacy, as does the association of the stringed instrument and the sword.

37141.jpg	The Curfew at Dōjōji	Torii Kiyomitsu	Japanese	ca. 1763	On a platform by a cherry tree, from the flowering branches of which a large temple bell is suspended, an actor recreates the legendary female role of Kiyohime, who dances to exorcise the pain of rejection by her beloved. Kiyomitsu depicts this scene in subdued green tones that are fully modulated by the three-color print process. The three seated figures at the rear, echoed by the three trees behind them, and the placement of these figures on a diagonally striped platform frame the enactment of this dramtic event within a repetition of forms. The sharp shifts in scale and the diagonal lines demonstrate a new awareness of perspective. The awkward stacking of the figures and the flattening effect of the boldly striped boards, however, return the viewer to the two-dimensional surface of the print. By self-consciously employing the tension between two-and three-dimensionality, and by juxtaposing decorative and architectural features, Kiyomitsu forged a distinctly new style.

37146.jpg	Shimizu Temple	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1765	Before inventing the brocade print (nishiki-e) around 1765–66, Harunobu made traditional color prints known as benizuri-e, literally "red-printed pictures." They were usually printed in two colors: red and green or red and yellow. The fresh yellow color in this print was probably added later after the original color had faded away.The theme of the Seven Episodes of Komachi, the ninth-century poet who was famed for her beauty and wit, already had an established pictorial convention. Here, Harunobu interprets this classical theme in a contemporary genre scene.The rectangular cartouche at the upper right gives the series title and the print's complete title Shimizu (Kiyomizu) Temple in Kyoto; the overlapping square cartouche contains a poem and an illustration of waterfalls at the temple. The poem reads:For what reason should you remove your sash or conduct yourself heedlessly? The beauty of the waterfall is unchanging.	風流七小町 しみず Title: Shimizu Temple Artist: Suzuki Harunobu (Japanese, 1725–1770) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1765 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper; Benizuri-e; small print (hosoban) Dimensions: 12 7/32 x 5 1/2 in.

37205.jpg	Hakone	Utagawa Hiroshige	Japanese	ca. 1848–49	In this dramatic night scene, the bearers carry their client in a palanquin, accompanied by torchbearers to light the dangerous and extremely difficult mountain pass. The image of the Hakone mountain seen here in the Reisho series is strikingly different from that of the Hoeidō Tōkaidō series. In this version, human activities take place in the triangular space at the left lower corner that is hemmed in by tall trees and mountains. By contrast, in the Hoeidō print, the panoramic vista of Lake Ashi and towering mountains is open before your eyes.	東海道五十三次 箱根 夜中松明とり Title: Hakone Artist: Utagawa Hiroshige (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1797–1858 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1848–49 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Overall: 8 3/4 x 13 3/4in.

According to the legend, a pregnant woman was killed by bandits, and her blood fell on the stone. Ever since, the stone has cried at night for her. The writing on the stone is partially legible, probably "Namu Amida Butsu" (Veneration to the Buddha Amitabha). This print gives the stone more narrative impact, but it represents a less picturesque landscape than the same station from the Hoeido Tokaido series.	東海道五十三次 日阪 夜啼石 無間山 小夜の中山 Title: Nissaka Artist: Utagawa Hiroshige (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1797–1858 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1848–49 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Overall: 8 3/4 x 13 3/4in.

Sakata Kinpira Nyudo is a legendary strong man in children's stories, in which he wrestles with wild beasts and goblins. Here he has been brought to the ground by drink. He leans his fierce head against a cask of sake; a giant, empty sake cup stands at his side. A painting of Daruma, the founder of Zen Buddhism, hangs in the alcove behind him. Legend has it that Daruma meditated for nine years, during which he resisted all manner of temptations with which demons besieged him. The irises below his portrait signify victory. Daruma gives this hero, who holds a string of Buddhist prayer beads in his hand, a reproachful look because of his lack of fortitude.

54551.jpg	Reluctant Leave-taking	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	late 1760s	The application of one color over another increased the range of color and offered a means of creating subtle effects, such as transparency and shadowing. In this print of a young man departing from his lover, we see Harunobu's inventive employment of polychrome techniques in search of illusionary effects. The woman adjusts her lover's robe from under the veil of the mosquito netting, which we perceive to alter the color of her kimono. Color has now completely replaced line in the transformation of decorative patterning, as evidenced in the patterning of the kimono. Large areas of color also help to organize the composition through the suggestion of spatial depth.

37268.jpg	The Gossips	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1767	In Harunobu's artistic vision, the interior life is defined by its relationship to the exterior world. In all three Harunobu prints in this exhibition, though the figures are placed suggestively close to the outside, their activities allude to the intimacy of the domestic realm. Indeed, the open screen stands as a metaphor for the harmonious integration of the domestic realm and the natural world. Together with greater naturalism in color, gesture, and posture, Harunobu's polychrome prints complete the transformation in the direction of a new ideal.

45069.jpg	Poem by Fujiwara no Motozane (ca. 860) from the Series Thirty-Six Poets	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1768	In this illustration of daily life, Harunobu captures a mother's affection for her child. While hanging clothes to dry on a bamboo rod, she follows her son with her eyes as he chases a chick. Looking over her shoulder, she then turns and reaches as if to restrain him.Shown in full bloom along the fence are white unohana flowers, which symbolize the fourth month of the lunar calendar, or early summer. Here, Harunobu associates the white blossoms and tenderness with a classical poem by one of the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, Fujiwara no Motozane, inscribed in a cloud-shaped cartouche at the top. The lyricism of the poem resonates with the expressive quality of the mother-and-child scene:Blossoming now in our mountain village, the unohana flowers look like snow still lingering on the hedge.(trans. by Jack Hillier)	百人一首 藤原元真 Title: Poem by Fujiwara no Motozane (ca. 860) from the Series Thirty-Six Poets Artist: Suzuki Harunobu (Japanese, 1725–1770) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1768 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper with embossing (karazuri) Dimensions: Image: 10 7/8 x 8 1/8 in.

54569.jpg	The Watchers and the Watched	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	1764–72	Harunobu, who is credited with the introduction of the polychrome print, also depicts courtesans on display in a Yoshiwara teahouse, but there is considerable difference in his treatment of the subject. While Moronobu observes the watchers and the watched with a uniform and impersonal gaze, Harunobu contrasts the observers and the observed.Like Moronobu, Harunobu uses a window, a frame within a frame, to depict inside and outside simultaneously, but, instead of a view from the street, he situates the viewer within the intimacy of the pleasure house. The neutral vantage point of a passerby has become the psychologically charged perspective of someone on the inside. We have a privileged view of the courtesans and can feast our eyes on the sumptuous attire that accentuates their beauty.Harunobu intensifies our awareness of the courtesans' self-conscious display by making the stage and audience areas more distinct. In the print by Moronobu there is an exchange between the inside and the outside. Here, however, the courtesans do not acknowledge the presence of the men peering through the window, though the letter that is being delivered by the young attendant is presumably from an admirer. There is also no visual overlap between interior and exterior spaces. The observers are confined to a cramped window in the background. They are distanced from us, unlike the passersby in the foreground of Moronobu's print, who are our surrogates. The harsh cropping of the watchers contrasts with the lavish depiction of the courtesans. This reduction of the observers to a crowd of faces and the small space allotted them serve to intensify their gaze. The observers are no longer passersby strolling along the street; here, looking is their sole activity.

54660.jpg	Forgetting Filial Piety	Torii Kiyonaga	Japanese	ca. 1781	A rainy morning outside the licensed pleasure quarters further delays a disheveled young man who nonchalantly brushes his teeth while his companion and her maids look on with barely concealed impatience. The inscription, "Forget not your parents' love; respect the virtue of filial piety," is in satiric contrast to the scene, which in other circumstances might indeed reflect a family at its morning routine. Torii Kiyonaga, the last influential artist of the Torii school, painted graceful, stylish figures in the late eighteenth century.

The poem is by Mibu no Tadamine, an early Heian courtier-poet (active 898–920) who was counted among the Thirty-Six Poetic Immortals (Sanjūrokkasen). The poem refers to the New Year’s custom of plucking pine saplings while composing poems praying for long life; it reads: Ne no hi suru nobe ni komatsu no nakariseba chiyo no tameshi ni nani o hikamashiIf on the day of the rat no pine saplingsare to be found what should we pluckto pray for longevity? —[Mibu no] Tadamine (Trans.

The theme of six beautiful rivers, each associated with a flower and a classical court poem, enjoyed great popularity in the late Edo period, especially among ukiyo-e printmakers. Mountain roses (yamabuki) are associated with the Ide Tamagawa, near Kyoto. This series parodies the typical depiction by replacing a courtier-poet and his two assistants fording the Ide Tamagawa with a courtesan in a courtier’s cap and two female assistants.	礫川亭永理 (鳥橋斎栄里)画 「畧六玉川 井出の山吹」 Title: Mountain Roses of Ide (Ide no Yamabuki), from the series A Parodic Six Jewel Rivers (Yatsushi Mu-Tamagawa) Artist: Rekisentei Eiri (Japanese, active ca. 1789–1801) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1795 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: H. 12 3/4 in.

37269.jpg	The Lion Dance	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	1789	In this illustration of a New Year's scene from the book "Ehon Waka Ebisu" (New Year's Day Customs), Utamaro has framed some women and children in a window as they watch a street performance of the shishimai, or lion dance. Several men form the lion, which chases after a boy, a man plays a flute while another adds to the excitement by beating two sticks together. A small boy with a frightened expression has been hoisted high for a better view out the window. Beside him a girl watches the spectacle intently, with her hand gripping a window ledge. Confining the spectators within a frame highlights their passivity and contrasts with the activity of the performers, who leap and stride across the horizontal expanse in the foreground. The concealment of their bodies reflects their psychological state, since the observers are completely absorbed in the act of watching and are not presenting themselves to be seen.

The artist's suspension of two figures in half-silhouette is a unique usage of the convention. These women behind a sudare byōbu (bamboo-slat screen) can view the festivities privately. To simulate the screen's diffusing quality, Utamaro softened the women's features in comparison to the other figures. Utamaro also dealt with the theme of voyeurism in this ehon (illustrated book) of kyōka (comic poetry), containing five double-page scenes of New Year's Day celebrations. The exquisite workmanship of this print is typical of ehon portfolios, which were commissioned by connoisseurs and consequently utilized only the finest ink, paper and bindings.

Here, Utamaro parodies the venerable tradition by setting a contemporary version in an Edo pleasure house. Instead of learned gentlemen, renowned courtesans practice calligraphy, play the Chinese board game go, perform on the lute, and paint pictures. Although the Four Accomplishments were traditionally depicted with equal emphasis, the perspectival arrangement of this print clearly favors painting over the other activities, which recede into the background.	喜多川歌麿画 琴棋書画 Title: The Four Accomplishments (Kinkishoga) Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1788–90 Culture: Japan Medium: Triptych of woodblock prints; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 15 x 30 in.

This seems to be the case here, where the vendor is showing a fan painted with the face of the Zen master Daruma to a beautiful young woman. Utamaro, however, has depicted the painting on the fan with such vigor that the Daruma seems as animated as the figures in this scene. With his finger in his mouth in a traditional gesture of envy, he appears to be beside himself with jealousy over the flirting young couple. The picture within the picture of the venerable first patriarch of Zen Buddhism caught in a humorous foible adds to the light-hearted eroticism of the scene.

37277.jpg	Narihira's Journey to the East	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	ca. 1797	The ninth chapter of The Tales of Ise is the most famous of the work and one of the mast frequently illustrated passages in Japanese literature. Narihira has lost all will to continue his worldly life in the capital and, in a disconsolate mood, leaves home with one or two close friends in search of a peaceful existence in the eastern provinces.Illustrators most often represented the moment during this Azuma kudari, or journey to the east, when the dispirited travelers pass the foot of Mount Fuji. Supposedly, this is the subject of the two triptychs here, but the two Edo artists had no qualms about abandoning the themes of loneliness and disillusionment that color the description of the journey in The Tales of Ise. In these mitate, or contemporary parodies of classical subjects, the small, gloomy group of travelers becomes an excuse for mounting a glamorous pageant of beautiful Edo-period women wearing the finest of contemporary fashions. So unconcerned are these artists with a faithful rendition of the story that even the romantic hero, Narihira himself, is represented as a pretty girl showing off her fine clothes. The triptych on the left by Utamaro represents a much more advanced form of ukiyo-e. Utamaro has removed all extraneous scenery from the composition so as to focus on Mount Fuji and the figures, which, cropped at the waist, are thrust into the viewer's space. Thus, the elaborate coiffures and headpieces and the bold decorative patterns of the garments seem to surround the viewer with a whirl of activity.

54870.jpg	A Woman Dressing a Girl for a the Kabuki Dance “Musume Dojōji,” with “Brother Picture” (E-kyōdai) of a Monkey Trainer	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	ca. 1795–96	The Ukiyo-e artist inserted a small picture within his composition to thrust one scenic idea into the heart of another and thereby generate a compelling dialogue between the two. Until the third quarter of the eighteenth century, the picture within a picture was formulated according to a literal representation of real objects, such as a folding fan, an uchiwa fan, a hanging scroll, or a mural. But the pictorial merits of the picture within a picture had become so compelling that artists began to apply the principle directly and abstractly without troubling to contain it within real objects. Therefore, artists in Utamaro's generation incorporated small pictures into their compositions without any such representational excuses. They invented the "E-kyodai," literally "brother picture." As is seen here, this is a secondary picture in a rectangular cartouche superimposed on the composition which reflects the main image, setting up an intriguing comparison that deepens the meaning. In this scene an ambitious mother is dressing her daughter to prepare her for her role of Kiyohime in the Kabuki dance "Musume Dojōji." In the upper vignette, we see a kind of monkey vaudeville act that is a parody of another Kabuki play, "Imoseyama." Thus, by association with the monkey skit, Utamaro casts the lower drama in a humorous, ironic light, suggesting that the daughter is tied to her ambitious mother's apron strings like a monkey to its master.	喜多川歌麿画 絵兄弟娘道成寺 見立猿廻し 「絵兄弟」 Title: A Woman Dressing a Girl for a the Kabuki Dance “Musume Dojōji,” with “Brother Picture” (E-kyōdai) of a Monkey Trainer Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1795–96 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print in the e-kyodai format; ink and color on paper Dimensions: H. 15 1/4 in.

37278.jpg	A View of the Pleasures of the Taiko and His Five Wives at Rakutō	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	1804	This triptych, published in 1804, portrays the famous cherry-blossom viewing party that Hideyoshi held in 1598. Ostensibly an innocent historical scene, its subject, the shogun whose heirs were overthrown by the ancestors of the ruling Yokugawa family was full of significance to the townsmen of Edo, who chafed under the restrictive and corrupt government. For his defiance of the official of ineffectual ban on this theme, Utamaro was jailed and spent fifty days in hand chains. This, combined with the extreme loss of inspiration and support he suffered with the death in 1797 of his friend and publisher Tatsuya, seems to have broken his spirit. Utamaro's final years are not represented by prints of the quality that marks the dazzling designs of the 1780's and 90's.	太閤五妻洛東遊観之図 Title: A View of the Pleasures of the Taiko and His Five Wives at Rakutō Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1804 Culture: Japan Medium: Triptych of woodblock prints; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 15 x 30 in.

37281.jpg	Chushingura Act III	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	ca. 1800	Utamaro uses the "E-kyodai" format here also to combine two scenes to humorous effect. Although both scenes in this work depict physical conflicts, they are conflicts of a radically different character. The upper cartouche contains a scene from "Chushingura," one of the most popular Kabuki plays, in which one feudal lord attacks another with a sword within the confines of Edo Castle, a grave breach of decorum that will lead to dire consequences. The conflict in the larger image, however, is merely a domestic love quarrel in which a man attempts to hit his nagging wife with a piece of kitchen equipment. In the spirit of jocular parody, Utamaro likens this petty household turmoil to the great tragic political drama "Chushingura."	忠臣蔵三段目 Title: Chushingura Act III Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1800 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: H. 15 1/8 in.

37312.jpg	Girls Entertained by Performers, from the illustrated book Flowers of the Four Seasons	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	1801	Theatrical performances are paradigms of people watching other people. There is a division of roles as well as a division of space. The actors move about a prescribed area, while the audience remains passively confined to another. This structure is reflected in ukiyo-e prints in which viewers are often physically separated from the objects of their gaze. They look down from balconies, peer through blinds and windows, and peek from behind screens and curtains. In this print, from a book illrstrated by Utamaro, young women, in imitation of courtly customs, watch traveling performers through the bamboo blinds of a folding screen. the unusual side view places us at a point equidistant from the audience and the performers. Since both groups are partially obscured by screens, Utamaro relegates us to the position of an outside observer. A courtesan in an elegant dress stands between the two groups. The cranes and the cloud in the screen behind her complete a circle that connects her with the performers, but the cascading folds of her robe unite with the dress of a seated girl, perhaps indicating a dual role on her part of entertaining and being entertained.	四季の花 Title: Girls Entertained by Performers, from the illustrated book Flowers of the Four Seasons Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1801 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 6 7/8 x 9 7/8 in.

If separated, each composition would be successful in its own right and, as both are signed, it would be difficult to recognize that either one was merely half of a diptych.

Utamaro portrays the courtesan half undressed, with her breast and thigh exposed. Her dress is rumpled at the cross of her thighs, adding even more of a sensual air to the scene. The man's elongated face, the courtesan's unkempt hair, and their pale skin enhance the erotic mood. The couple's seemingly fixed poses, emphasized by the way they look at and touch each other, makes it appear as if they are acting out a scene in a play.

55118.jpg	The Love Letter	Torii Kiyonaga	Japanese	late 18th century	The ukiyo-e print tradition was part of a lively popular culture, and its artists often made humorous allusions to plays and poems as well as prints by other artists. Here Kiyonaga parodies a print depicting Act VII of the popular Kabuki play Chushingura, or "Loyal League of Forty-seven Ronin." The drama relates how the ronin avenged the death of their lord. In this scene a courtesan, instead of the leader of the ronin, stands on the veranda of a teahouse reading a letter. The subject is presumably love rather than revenge. Another courtesan, hidden beneath the veranda, like the spy in the play, reads the long letter as it unrolls. On the balcony above, a teahouse client reads the letter with the help of a mirror, a travesty of the selfless woman in Chushingura, who sold herself to the teahouse to raise the money her husband needed to join the ronin. The format of the hashira-e, or pillar print, is ideally suited to depict this vertical scene. "With a few hints of architecture, Kiyonaga has divided the picture plane into three levels. Our eyes are directed up and down the vertical expanse by the observers at the top and bottom, who focus on the "performance" at the center.

Each displays two beauties, with landscapes in insets that reference the scenic “Eight Views of Ōmi” and correspond to chapters from the tale. In the print representing Chapter 41, “Spirit Summoner,” the encircled geese and autumn grasses evoke a poem by the Akashi Lady. On the left, Chapter 19, “A Thin Veil of Clouds,” is recalled by the landscape of Awazu, a name that refers either to Genji’s interest in Akikonomu, or to a poetic exchange between Genji and the Akashi Lady.	鳥文斎栄之画 「浮世源氏八景 幻 落雁 薄雲 晴嵐」 Title: Spirit Summoner; Wild Geese Returning Home (Maboroshi; Rakugan) (right) and A Thin Veil of Clouds; Clearing Weather (Usugumo; Seiran) (left), from the series Eight Views of The Tale of Genji in the Floating World (Ukiyo Genji hakkei) Artist: Chōbunsai Eishi (Japanese, 1756–1829) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1797–99 Culture: Japan Medium: Diptych of woodblock prints; ink and color on paper Dimensions: H. 14 3/8 in.

45039.jpg	Dance of the Beach Maidens	Torii Kiyonaga	Japanese	late 18th century	Although Narihira's story became a literary work in the ninth century, no textual record of his elder brother, Yukihira, is known before the late fourteenth century, when the famous playwright Kanze Zeami used the legend of the exiled courtier as the basis for a Noh drama. The tale of Yukihira was subsequently reworked in many different forms. In the early eighteenth century, the playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon created it as Matsukaze and Murasame, to be performed in the puppet theater. Later, his version of the play was performed as a Kabuki drama. Finally, the motif of the unfortunate sisters was extracted from the plot and choreographed as a dance to be performed between acts of unrelated plays. This performance, The Dance of the Beach Maidens, is represented here. The topic has undergone a considerable change from the historical source in the legend of Yukihira; indeed, the existence of the exiled courtier is not even implied here. Instead, the focus is on the two sisters, who have become Edo-period goddesses, far removed from the impoverished girls of the original legend. In fact, in his pillar print, Torii Kiyonaga has seen fit to take the sisters away from Suma Beach and locate them at the foot of Mount Fuji.

Relaxing in a boat, this beauty actually parodies one of the strongmen, Katsusenba Oteiroku, of the Chinese novel of the fourteenth century, The 108 Heroes of the Suikoden, a tale of the revenge of a band of criminals against a corrupt government.Kuniyoshi, influenced by European models, often incorporated Western techniques in prints with nominally foreign themes. As this series relates to a Chinese story, the artist has contrasted the contemporary beauty to a landscape drawn in a foreign style, using Western perspective and stylized scenery (clouds and trees).

45089.jpg	Osen of the Kagiya Teahouse	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1769	The narrow rectangular shape of this pillar print creates an arresting image of Osen, the popular waitress of the Kagiya teahouse at the Kasamori Inari Shrine in Edo. The height of the willowy Osen is accentuated by the tall slender post of the torii gate partially visible at right. The pillar, roof, and lantern of the teahouse as well as the footed table of cakes restrict the area of the print even more, while simultaneously identifying the woman portrayed as Osen and enhancing her gracefulness. Written on the lantern are the name of the shop, Kagiya, and Oyasumi dokoro, meaning "rest stop."This depiction of Osen turning back to look at a cuckoo in flight is not a mere snapshot but a memorable pose of her essential charm and striking appearance. This print presents the beautiful Osen more as a popular icon than as part of a narrative scene.

Here, to illustrate the hour of midnight, Utamaro chose a mother who sleepily emerges from a mosquito net to attend to her child, who rubs the sleep from his eyes. The personal, everyday nature of the subject exemplifies the new interest in the individual that emerged during the mid- to late Edo period.	喜多川歌麿画 「風俗美人時計 子ノ刻 妾」 Title: “Hour of the Rat: Mistress,” from the series Women’s Daily Customs (Fuzoku bijin tokei) Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1790 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 14 3/8 x 9 5/8 in.

55233.jpg	Lovers	Isoda Koryūsai	Japanese	1770	The poem in Chinese on this print conceals a light eroticism much as the komusō priest costume with its basket-like hat (seen under the woman's arm) conceals the lovers on their way to the tryst that this print depicts.The study of Chinese classics and poetry was a major part of an elite education in Japan for many centuries. With the new affluence and economic clout of the merchant class at this time, merchant sons (and daughters to a more limited extent) were also taught in academies in Osaka and around the country. Both samurai and merchant scholars wrote poems in Chinese and read old anthologies. Chinese poetry seemed especially suited for encoding political and occasionally, erotic meanings within lyrics innocuous at first glance.

The most splendid costumes were created during the late 18th century for these arbiters of fashion and style. Robes of silk crepe, velvet or satin were worn with broad sashes (obi) of gold and silk brocades. Her pyramidal coiffure, piled high on her head and embellished with elaborate hairpins is a dramatic change from the more casual styles of the early 18th century and required the care of a professional hairdresser.Tokyo Bay in summer is pictured on her fan, with a poem by Magao, a contemporary writer. It was translated by Louis Ledoux as follows:Even as guests do,So do the summer breezesEver returning,Come to Sodegaura,Place of heavenly coolness.	喜多川歌麿画 「南国美人合」 此すミ Title: The Courtesan Konosumi, from the series “Beauties of the Southern Quarter”(Nangoku bijin awase) Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1793–94 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 14 1/2 x 9 5/16 in.

55365.jpg	A Young Man and Women in the Moor of Musashino; Parody of the Akuta River episode of the Tale of Ise (Ise monogatari)	Attributed to Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1765–66	This image is a parody of the iconic episode of The Tales of Ise in which the young hero of the amorous saga abducts another young girl. He takes her to Musashi Province, far east of the capital, and, pursued by the local authorities, he hides the girl in a field of tall flowering grass and escapes. In order to force him out of hiding, his pursuers begin to set fire to the field; then they hear the voice of the girl:Field of Musashi—Do not burn it down today!Like the young grasseshere my lover crouching hidesand I too lie in hiding.(trans. H. Jay Harris)Here the artist, whom we presume is Suzuki Harunobu because of the distinctive figural style, has represented the characters from the tenth-century classic in the garb of contemporary Edo. The kneeling figure, though represented with effeminate facial features, has the distinctive hair style of a wakashu (male youth) of the day, as often depicted by the artist. There is another iimpression of this print in the collection Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, Leiden, that has the signature of the haikai poet and amateru artist Suikōdō Sakei, but we can assume that he is adding his name to the print as the patron who commissioned a calendar print as he did on other works.

54389.jpg	Horse Pattern (Koma shōbu), from the series Horses	Katsushika Hokusai	Japanese	1822	This surimono is one of thirty-three prints in a set that was commissioned for the year of the horse in 1822. However, the images are not of horses but are conjured up from words associated with the animal. The print illustrates a fan and a tobacco pouch above a tissue case. The tobacco pouch is made of deerskin dyed with a pattern of horses and dandelions in a technique known as shōbūkawa.Hokusai's intentionally paradoxical signature reads Fusenkyo Iitsu hitsu ("painted by Iitsu in his Nonpainting Studio").

51086.jpg	Night Rain at Ōyama, from the series "Eight Famous Views of Kanagawa"	Utagawa Toyokuni II	Japanese	ca. 1830	Utagawa Toyoshige, student of the first Toyokuni (1769–1825), succeeded to his master's name as Toyokuni II in 1825. In Utagawa genealogy, Toyoshige and the famous Hiroshige are something like cousins. The most famous print in the series "Eight Famous Views of Kanagawa," set west of Edo, is Night Rain at Ōyama. Mount Ōyama, the ancient center of mountain asceticism where the guardian king Fudō Myōō was enshrined, became a popular pilgrimage site during the eighteenth century. Prayers for rain were offered there, and it became standard to depict this place in the rain. The mysterious appearance of the mountain at night, with Mount Fuji visible in the distance, is achieved by rendering it without outline, in pointed contrast to the sharply delineated torrents in varying tones.Despite differences between the steady downpour in Hiroshige's Karasaki print (JP52) they share an overall atmospheric effect..

The sake cup, seen on its side at the upper right, bears the name of the series. The tablets at the upper right and left read, respectively, "Kenbishi," the name of the sake brand, and "Hanazuma," the name of the courtesan.Utamaro pared the composition down to basic elements. The graceful beauty of the image is enhanced by its undulating curves, the lady's attenuated form, and the deeply embossed pattern (karazuri) on her robe. The viewer's interest is piqued by the cropped mirror, one of Utamaro's favorite pictorial motifs. It is left to the imagination to determine what lies beyond the frame and within the mirror's reflection.	喜多川歌麿画 「名取酒六家選 兵庫屋華妻 坂上の剣菱」 Title: "Hanazuma of Hyōgoya, Kenbishi of Sakagami” from the series The Peers of Saké Likened to Select Denizens of Six Houses (Natori zake rokkasen: Hyōgoya Hanazuma, Sakagami no Kenbishi) Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1794 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: H. 14 3/4 in.

The retainers, led by Yuranosuke, bide their time and finally take revenge. Yuranosuke is seen here in the final act of the play after the entire group has attacked the residence of the former associate and avenged their lord's death.

55743.jpg	Ghosts of the Taira at Daimotsu Bay	Utagawa Kuniyoshi	Japanese	1843–47	The sea itself seems to convulse as an army of ghosts emerges in the distance to menace a ship full of warriors of the Minamoto clan, recalling an ancient battle. In spring of 1185, the Minamoto clan vanquished the rival Taira clan in a decisive sea battle, ushering in a period of warrior rule. Kuniyoshi describes the Taira ghosts with fluid forms in a soft palette, a contrast to the vivid colors and razor-sharp clarity of the foreground. Kuniyoshi often used silhouette—itself a symbol of evanescence—as a method of depicting such ethereal subjects as ghosts, around which developed a genre that became increasingly popular in the nineteenth century.	歌川国芳画 「大物の浦平家の亡霊」 Title: Ghosts of the Taira at Daimotsu Bay Artist: Utagawa Kuniyoshi (Japanese, 1797–1861) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1843–47 Culture: Japan Medium: Triptych of woodblock-printed books (nishiki-e); ink and color on paper Dimensions: Oban triptych: Each H. 14 3/4 in.

The palace interior teems with stylish women, and Genji and Asagao are shown exchanging poems; in the tale, they do so only through intermediaries. The figures, tall and slender with refined features, are characteristic of Chōbunsai Eishi’s prints and paintings.

55751.jpg	Two Figures	Okumura Masanobu	Japanese		The invention of color block printing by the mid-eighteenth century irrevocably transformed the vigorous early ukiyo-e style. The new technique, which used separate blocks for each color, placed greater attention on coordinating the component parts and emphasized the process of color overlays. Masanobu's pioneering efforts in the field of color printing advanced a new aesthetic, one in which the essential quality of the print was dependent on line and color. As the articulation of the early ukiyo-e artist's virtuosic line diminished, a new style featuring graceful and lyrical lines bound to color harmonies emerged.

55793.jpg	A Girl Writing a Letter	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	18th century	The seated young woman has been writing what is probably a love letter, but she attempts to hide it from the man who has just entered. The painting on the sliding screen behind the figures provides Harunobu with the opportunity to elaborate on the theme of letter writing by alluding to a classical episode from ancient Chinese history. Su Wu (J.: Sobu), a Chinese general of the Han period (206 B.C.–A.D. 220), was captured by invading forces and held captive for nineteen years in Central Asia. He was ultimately rescued by his people, who had received Su Wu's messages by geese, which functioned like carrier pigeons in Asia. By invoking the plight of Su Wu, Harunobu's print suggests that the present letter was also intended to be the crucial link in a dramatic adventure, had the young man not discovered it.

45068.jpg	A Flute-Playing Monk (Komusō); The Fourth Month (Uzuki), from the series Fashionable Poetic Immortals of the Four Seasons (Fūzoku shiki kasen)	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1768	Komusō were itinerant Zen Buddhist monks of the Fuke sect who traveled the countryside, covering their heads with oversize basketlike hats and playing bamboo flutes (shakuhachi). Here the young monk has caught the attention of young women, who ogle him from indoors. He turns to watch the flight of a cuckoo bird (hototogisu), a symbol of “the fourth month,” the beginning of summer, and fleeting love. The anonymous poem is from the summer section of Seven Hundred Poems Compiled by Lord Shirakawa (Shirakawa-dono shichi-hyakushu, no. 136), compiled around 1265: Hito mo toe saku ya uzuki no hana-zakarikōchō ni nitaru yado no kakine o Let everyone knowthat now in the fourth month, the deutzia flowers in bloom resemble butterflies covering a hedge in the garden.—Trans.

45071.jpg	The Curtain Clam	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese		The young ladies are at the shore. One is getting out of a chair while the other ties a sash about her hips below her "obi." A subtle tone of carpe diem cleverly embedded in the poem deepens the provacative tinge of this charming scene, one of a series that plays on the theme of types of seashells. The "sudare-gai" is a mollusk that was named for the boiled blinds of reed or thin bamboo slats that are still used in Japan to provide the shade and privacy between the interior space and the outside garden. In poetic convention it is a motif of intrinsic eroticism and has a seasonal association with spring. In this print, a small "sudare" covers the window of the palalquin that has carried these courtesans to the shore for a spring outing.Nami kakaru fukiage no hama nosudaregai nami mo zoorusu isogi hirowan.A cool breeze whips the waves onto shorelet's hurry to gather the shells.	すだれ貝 Title: The Curtain Clam Artist: Suzuki Harunobu (Japanese, 1725–1770) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: H. 11 1/4 in.

45065.jpg	Onna San no Miya (the Third Princess)	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	1768–70	For Harunobu's sophisticated patrons, this deceptively calm scene of a palace beauty on a spring day invoked one of classic literature's most stirring tragedies. The young woman in aristocratic garb with her lively cat appears frequently in ukiyo-e and recalls a pivotal incident in the early-eleventh-century romance of Genji, the "shining prince" who personified the Heian court's ideal of aesthetic sensitivity and discernment in the conduct of personal and public life. The doll-like figure with long flowing hair and trailing robe recalls the naive young imperial princess San no Miya, recently wed to the aging Genji. On a spring day, her cat ran outside, swinging open the bamboo blind and revealing the young nobles playing ball in the garden. A branch of cherry in full bloom suggests the setting and signals the flowering of love as well as its inevitably short duration. San no Miya caught sight of the handsome Kashiwagi, son of Genji's boyhood friend. In the alchemy of youth and forbidden love that transpires, the novel weaves the themes of passion and fateful retribution for social transgression, recasting Genji's own youth in intense and tragic tones that are believed by the sweet innocence in Harunobu's vision.

54863.jpg	Two Ladies	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	1764–72	In 1765 Harunobu introduced nishiki-e, the polychrome woodblock print, adding further luxury and realism to ukiyo-e art. Although the use of reflection appeared in the earliest woodblock prints, the advent of color and use of embossing and mica enhanced the illusion represented by the mirror.In this print two courtesans gaze at each other through a mirror, using reflection as a means of communication. The artist enables the viewer to see both the back of the woman's head and her face at the same time. The portrayal reflects the tradition of women cutting the hair from the nape of the neck. A beautiful nape was essential to female beauty and was also considered an area of erotic charm.With the addition of the poem to his print, Harunobu heightens the power and narrative of his image. The poem, by Mitsunari, a Heian-period poet, reads:Even if the mirror feels sad, it is still clear as before.Rather it increases in its clarity,And it never forgets the image it once reflected.Through personification, the poet gives the mirror the human abilities to love and to remember.

55804.jpg	Parting of Lovers: The Morning After	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1765–70	Harunobu's keen interest in translucent objects, such as the mosquito net, was well served by his invention of the polychrome print technique. The new availability of different shades of colors enabled him to show the subtle changes that are necessary to create the look of translucence.In the horizontal print (yoko-e) depicting lovers parting in the morning, the woman is willingly entangled in the net, reluctant to leave the scene of a tryst. In contrast, the man is outside the net, ready to return to the reality of everyday life. Harunobu deftly uses the mosquito net to illustrate their predicament.

To distinguish the corporeal from the noncorporeal, Harunobu renders the characters inside the dream bubble in gray and leaves the rest of the background unprinted.

55434.jpg	Woman Reading a Letter under a Mosquito Net	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	ca. 1798	Utamaro portrays a woman who is concentrating intensely on a letter. Her entire body leans forward, and she firmly grasps the letter, holding it close to her face. The mosquito net works as a device that keeps the woman away from the light, increasing her anxiety and desire to move closer to it. The light from the lantern spreads out in a triangle, highlighting the woman's intense expression and creating a dramatic effect.	喜多川歌麿画 蚊帳の中の文読み美人 Title: Woman Reading a Letter under a Mosquito Net Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1798 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: H. 15 in.

45477.jpg	Bathtime (Gyōzui)	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	ca. 1801	Utamaro often took his inspiration from the lives of common people, and he treated the theme of mother and child with more poignancy than did most artists. In Woman Washing a Baby in a Tub he depicted a mother performing a daily task that centers directly around her child. The rather large woman hunches over ungracefully as she bathes her son. In one hand the child holds a toy water bucket, which both echoes the activity in the tub and instructs him in the rituals of bathing; with the other hand he grabs his mother's arm in an effort to push her away. To enhance the visual excitement, Utamaro crops the bucket, the woman's leg, and the child's kimono. Prints such as these were the inspiration for the first series of prints made by the Impressionist artist Mary Cassatt.	行水 Title: Bathtime (Gyōzui) Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1801 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 14 11/16 x 9 7/8 in.

37337.jpg	Viewing Cherry Blossoms	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	1790	At times the observer is the main subject. In this leaf from a book by Utamaro, a lively group of women takes in the view from a balcony in the Yoshiwara district. They crowd against the railing, some leaning over to call out to those below. The objects of their attention cannot be seen, but their presence is indicated by the parasols that bob among the sea of blossoming trees in the foreground. This depiction may be a humorous play on the convention of portraying women viewing cherry blossoms, because in this case the women are more interested in the passerby than in the celebrated flowers.

53653.jpg	A Woman and a Cat	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	ca. 1793–94	In this domestic scene, a young woman sits in front of a lacquered needlework box, folding a length of resist-dyed fabric. Several shades have been used to render the degrees of translucence of the gossamer silk. More substantial cloth is used as a foil—the woman's obi is of dense brocade and her light yellow robe has a simple lattice pattern. Colors swirl on the ground, accentuated by bold outlines.In a common parody of a literary theme, the bobtailed cat playing with the cloth is an allusion to Nyosan no Miya, the "Third Princess" in The Tale of Genji. She was first seen and admired by Kashiwagi, one of the heroes of the Tale, when two cats chasing each other accidentally parted the curtain concealing her. In Utamaro's interpretation, there is no need to move the fabric aside. Utamaro has made sure that we see the charms of the seamstress through the sheer silk as he exploits one of his favorite techniques for showing off his printmaking skills.

54864.jpg	Two Ladies, Each with a Portion of a Lacquered Mirror	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	1790s	Utamaro selectively used reflection to reinforce narrative and to emphasize themes. In this print, a standing woman holds up a mirror to a seated woman. Ironically, Utamaro chose to show the standing woman's reflection in the lacquered back of the mirror rather than the seated woman's in the mirror itself. The image involves a dual relationship: two women hold halves of the same object and perform a similar action. Their mimicking of each other duplicates the role of the mirror, which Utamaro placed between them as a communicative device.

The mother, whose exposed breasts are accented with pink, gazes down at her son; meanwhile, he looks up her kimono. Through the diaphanous material we see both the child's head and the mother's leg. Utamaro accommodated the vertical format of the print by cropping the image at each side.Here, as in many other prints in this exhibition, the artist covers the woman's legs but emphasizes her naked breasts. "With their obvious sexuality designed to feed erotic fantasies, these images may have served as a substitute for shunga, or explicitly erotic prints, whose publication was illegal.

53654.jpg	“Hanaōgi of the Gomeirō,” from the series Comparing the Charms of Beauties (Bijin kiryō kurabe: Gomeirō Hanaōgi)	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	ca. 1794–95	Characterizations of women were Utamaro's great contribution to Japanese art. In the large head-portraits he executed, he used the hands and eyes of a sitter to indicate temperament. In this portrait of an unidentified courtesan, we can tell much about the woman's character. Her head juts forward in a determined way, revealing a long and well-groomed neck. Her hair is fashionably dressed with seven pins, her face plump, with resolute eyes set straight ahead. But it is perhaps her hands, tucked beneath the commanding obi, that reveal most—by not being visible. Courtesans announced their profession by tying the obi in front. When sumptuary laws were passed to control the lavishness of clothes, obi were not mentioned, and they became a focal point of extravagance in dress. Creating the impression of great volume through the diagonal lines of the clothing, Utamaro has stressed this obi, which almost seems to precede its wearer.

37343.jpg	The Dance of the Beach Maidens	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	early 19th century	Although Narihira's story became a literary work in the ninth century, no textual record of his elder brother, Yukihira, is known before the late fourteenth century, when the famous playwright Kanze Zeami used the legend of the exiled courtier as the basis for a Noh drama. The tale of Yukihira was subsequently reworked in many different forms. In the early eighteenth century, the playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon created it as Matsukaze and Murasame, to be performed in the puppet theater. Later, his version of the play was performed as a Kabuki drama. Finally, the motif of the unfortunate sisters was extracted from the plot and choreographed as a dance to be performed between acts of unrelated plays. This performance, The Dance of the Beach Maidens, is represented here; the topic has undergone a considerable change from the historical source in the legend of Yukihira, indeed, the existence of the exiled courtier is not even implied here. Instead, the focus is on the two sisters who have become Edo-period goddesses, far removed from the impoverished girls of the original legend.Kitagawa Utamaro's triptych represents this subject with only the faintest echo of its textual source in the romantic legend of Yukihira. Here, the two sisters have multiplied into nine beautiful women in grass skirts enacting a meaningless charade with buckets of seawater. In the milieu of the sophisticated urban culture of Edo, this frivolous evocation of rusticity appealed to a sentimental nostalgia for "the simple life of the sea."

After two brothers caught a sculpture of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (Kannon) in their net, they and the village leader who built the first temple to house the statue were worshipped as manifestations of the deity in the three shrines of Asakusa, and an annual festival in their honor has continued to the present day.

The large figure in the foreground is a courtesan passing through the curtained door of a public bathhouse. Our attention, however, is drawn to the smaller-scale woman in the background who is framed within a latticed window. She is in a state of undress, but she is so eager to see who is in the entrance corridor that she has only half-covered herself with a cloth. She steadies herself with a hand on the window as she peers out. Traditionally, a bathing woman is an object of voyeurism. Koryūsai adds a twist to the theme by turning her into an observer as well.

56040.jpg	In a Pleasure House	Torii Kiyonaga	Japanese	late 18th century	The principal figure in this composition is a courtesan who has paused in front of a folding screen. With her head inclined and her hand resting on the edge of the screen, she stands in an attitude of watching. The cropping necessitated by the narrow format adds mystery to this scene because the object of the courtesan's gaze is beyond the border of the print. In the background another courtesan tenderly observes her sleeping lover. One can surmise that the woman in the foreground also watches a sleeping man, especially since the edge of a bed is just visible at the lower right.

56050.jpg	Kayoi Komachi, from the series "Seven Episodes of the Poet Komachi"	Utagawa Toyokuni I	Japanese	ca. 1795	This print is one of the most exquisite ukiyo-e prints featuring women. The subject matter of "Kayoi Komachi," inscribed in the upper right corner, is drawn from a tragic Noh play. The poet Ono no Komachi promises to meet her ardent suitor Fukakusa Shōjō if he agrees to spend a hundred nights on the stepstool of an oxcart. After ninety-nine nights, he dies. This print is a parody of the popular story. A courtesan is on her way home from visiting her favorite customer, knowing that their meetings will eventually end. Both Fukakusa Shōjō, in the Noh play, and the courtesan in this print share a profound sense of promise unfulfilled. Here, the mistiness of the night (achieved by means of an ink spray) and the woman's disheveled hair are suggestive of their romantic lingering.

56053.jpg	Takigawa of the Ogiya Pleasure House	Utagawa Toyokuni I	Japanese	early 19th century	Robed in a splendid floral kimono, the famous courtesan, Takigawa of the Ogiya Pleasure House, sits before a hanging scroll portrait of Ono no Komachi in her late years. Ono no Komachi, a great poet of the Heian period, was admired for her beauty. Her legendary decline into decrepit old age was taken as a paradigm for the Buddhist concept of the ephemerality of life and its pleasures. Toyokuni shows the two famous beauties—one his contemporary and the other her predecessor by many centuries—facing each other in mirror image. This striking juxtaposition accentuates the dramatic contrast between them; Takigawa appears in the full bloom of her beauty, emphasized by the vivacious wildflowers which flow through her kimono, while the old woman Ono no Komachi leans on her staff among drab ditch reeds in the colorless hanging scroll. Thus, the great beauty of Takagawa is threatened by a pungent memento mori.

54396.jpg	Ichikawa Danjuro IV in the Role of Kagekiyo in the Play Enlightenment from a Series of Portraits of Danjūrō	Utagawa Toyokuni II	Japanese	ca. 1834	This surimono shows a close-up image of Ichikawa Danjūrō IV in the role of Kagekiyo, who attained salvation as a faithful follower of Buddhism, despite his villainous battles. In this swaggering performance, he wears a kimono displaying a triangular pattern of scales, symbolizing a dragon or snake. This surimono of the fourth Danjūrō is from a series of portrait busts of Danjūrō I–VIII. This has a modified frame decorated with a seal script go (five), perhaps a part of another of Danjūrō's names, Gogawa.

56073.jpg	Woman and Small Boy	Katsukawa Shunchō	Japanese		In this print the artist employs seasonal clues to suggest the summer setting. Mother and child are engaged in a leisure summertime activity, a luxury they can enjoy as members of the merchant class (chōnin). The child points to a cicada (a summer insect) on a tree branch, and his mother shows interest in her son's discovery. Each holds an accessory common in summer: he a parasol, she a fan.Shunchō often used the format of hashira-e, or pillar print—a narrow, vertical composition. Here, following the Japanese convention in which images are cropped to conform to the print's dimensions, he truncated the parasol, the mother's left arm, and part of her hair. With particular skill he rendered just enough of the tree to let the viewer know where the child's attention is focused.

56091.jpg	Narihira's Journey to the East	Rekisentei Eiri	Japanese	late 18th century	The ninth chapter in The Tales of Ise is the most famous passage of the text and one of the most frequently illustrated in Japanese literature. Narihira has lost all will to continue his worldly life in the capital and, in a disconsolate mood, leaves home with one or two close friends in search of a peaceful existence in the eastern provinces. Illustrators most often represented the moment during this Azuma kudari, or journey to the east, when the dispirited travelers pass the foot of Mount Fuji. Supposedly, that is the subject of the triptych here, but the artist had no qualms whatsoever about abandoning the loneliness and disillusionment of the journey described in The Tales of Ise. In this mitate, or contemporary parody of classical subjects, the poetic description of the small, gloomy group of travelers is used as an excuse to mount a glamorous pageant of beautiful Edo-period women wearing the finest contemporary fashions. So unconcerned was the artist with the faithful rendition of the text that even the romantic hero, Narihira himself, was represented as a pretty girl showing off her fine clothes.

56116.jpg	Courtesan or Actor as Courtesan Pouring Tea by the Light of a Lantern	Utagawa Toyokuni I	Japanese		Though Tokugawa sumptuary laws extended to a courtesan's bedding (yagu), this item became progressively more lavish in the eighteenth century. A contemporary writer has described embroidered futons and black silk velvet sleeping robes (yogi) lined with red crepe and padded with finest cotton. Bedding was ostentatiously displayed in brothels as a symbol of status. In this unfinished ink sketch, perhaps a leaf intended for a book of erotica, a courtesan crouches beside her cast-off sleeping robe, which is curled in the shape of her body, and pours tea for an unseen companion.

The prints are arranged on facing leaves according to themes or in a way that creates an attractive arrangement of designs, complementary in both color and shape. The printing techniques, pigments, and paper used for surimono were often the highest quality, and represent the epitome of late Edo-period woodblock printing.	柳々居辰斎画 子春 嫁入の具『春雨集』 摺物帖 Title: Accoutrements for a Bride, from the Spring Rain Collection (Harusame shū), vol. 1 Artist: Ryūryūkyo Shinsai (Japanese, active ca. 1799–1823) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: probably 1816 (Year of the Rat) Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print (surimono); ink and color on paper Dimensions: 5 1/2 x 7 7/16 in.

54559.jpg	Set of Utensils for the Tea Ceremony	Kubo Shunman 窪俊満	Japanese	1810s	In this elegant still-life surimono by Shunman, accoutrements for a New Year’s tea ceremony are arrayed along with a branch of camellia, a flower that blooms at the end of winter and beginning of spring according to the lunar calendar. The poem reads:春の立けるひ茶の席上にて大ふくにたつる茶の湯の口きりや としの手前に春は来にけり古今仲成 Haru no tachikeru hi cha no sekijō niteŌbuku ni tatsuru chanoyu no kuchikiri ya toshi no temae niharu wa ki ni keriAt a tea gathering on the day spring arrives:Sipping auspicious teamade with New Year’s water, the tea ceremony begins— as spring arrives before the official start of the year. —Kokin no Nakanari (trans. by John T. Carpenter)The kyōka puns on tea-related terms such as ōbuku (New Year’s tea), chanoyu (tea ceremony), temae (formal tea preparation). Temae also serves as a pivot word here, meaning also “before the start of the year,” which alludes to the opening lines of the first poem of the Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern (Kokin wakashu): Toshi no uchi ni haru wa ki ni keri … (Spring has arrived before the end of the old year). The pouch for the tea caddy is decorated with the emblem of the Go-gawa poetry group, a seal script rendering of the character go, 五, meaning “five.”	Title: Set of Utensils for the Tea Ceremony Artist: Kubo Shunman 窪俊満 (Japanese, 1757–1820) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1810s Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print (surimono); ink and color on paper Dimensions: 5 7/16 x 7 1/4 in.

54723.jpg	Screen and Utensils for the Incense Ceremony	Kubo Shunman	Japanese	19th century	Surimono, literally "printed matter", are high-quality, limited-edition, privately commissioned, woodblock-printed "greeting cards," mainly produced between the 1790s and the 1830s, and usually ordered for New Year's greetings. On this surimono by Shunman, we can see preparations for an incense ceremony: an incense tray is depicted with an incense heater and tools for burning the incense. A piece of hot charcoal is placed in the ash to warm the small piece of incense wood, so it can release its fragrance. The ash and the charcoal are handled and shaped with the fire tools. The preparations take place behind a curtained partition, which suggests a wedding or a special celebration. There are three poems depicted on the print. The first poem suggests a wedding; the second, a hazy spring moon and plum flowers; and the third, Mount Fuji and the first song of spring by the bush warbler. All the motifs have auspicious meanings, as they evoke spring and therefore the renewal of life—appropriate symbols for a New Year's greeting.

A few buds and blossoms of plum are scattered nearby.This surimono (privately published woodblock print) was created to celebrate the first lunar month of spring of the year of the rabbit, 1819. The poet Chōkandō Harumichi 長閑堂春道 wrote a 31-syllable kyōka verse on the traditional poetic topic of snow, moon and flowers, and how they all appear together in this New Year’s scene:あわ雪の いろに月花 照そひておもしろきことの そろう春かなThe colors of the moon and blossoms shimmer in the light snow—what a delightful surprise for all to be arrayed this spring!(Trans. John T. Carpenter)The artist Hokushū became a pupil of the famous Katsushika Hokusai in the 1810s and was primarily active as a surimono illustrator and book illustrator. He also used the art names Joryūken 如柳軒, Joryū 如柳 (as in the seal here), and Taisōsha 戴藻舎 (recalling one of Hokusai’s art names, Taitō 戴斗).	葛飾北秀画 月下の兎 Title: Rabbit in the Snow beneath the Moon 月下の兎 Artist: Katsushika Hokushū 葛飾北秀 (Japanese, active ca. 1810s–1830s) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1819 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print (surimono); ink, color, and metallic pigments on paper Dimensions: Shikishi-ban; 8 1/8 x 7 1/4 in.

The image shows a set of woodblock-printed books, the Kogessho, which is an annotated edition of the Tale of Genji published around 1673. Next to it, scattered playing cards depict two chapters from the Tale of Genji: the Kobai (Rose Plum) and the Wakamurasaki (Lavender), both illustrated with not only their usual pictorial depictions, but "Genji-crests" (Genji-mon) as well. The two chapters are related to the incense culture and the Genji-crest is a symbol used in the Genji-ko incense game. The poem on the print mentions the two chapters and the dawn of the New Year in Edo. Classical literature, incense, poetry, and the traditions of the incense game are all captured in one composition.

54118.jpg	Two Women Looking in Mirrors	Kubo Shunman	Japanese	19th century	This composition is activated by a diagonal line formed by the darting gazes of the two women and the spectator. The standing woman looks at the reflection of her face while she also sees the reflection of the back of her head. Instead of looking at the mirror in her own hand, the seated woman gazes at the standing woman. Does she see her own reflection in the mirror that reflects the standing woman's coiffure? Does the standing woman also see a reflection of the seated lady as well as the back of her head? The seated lady holds a mirror, whose verso bears a family crest with two characters combined into a diphthong. Perhaps this wordplay mimicks the theme of overlap and duality conveyed by the use of three mirrors. The poem translates as; "If you use a mirror which reflects ancient time, that will bring you the flawless virtue of the present emperor."

The series was commissioned by a branch of the Asakusa kyōka poetry group based in the city of Utsunomiya, north of Edo (present-day Tokyo). The artist Teisai Hokuba, an early pupil of the great ukiyo-e master Katsushika Hokusai, was best known as a painter, but also occasionally created deluxe surimono commissions. Here, he demonstrated how painterly effects could be accomplished in the medium of woodblock printing by eliminating outlines and employing subtle use of gradated ink tones (accomplished by manual wiping the printing blocks).	摺物帖 『春雨集』 『花鳥六番之内 下野宇都宮』 桃に山鳩 Title: Spring Rain Collection (Harusame shū), vol. 3: Mountain Dove and Peach Flowers Artist: Teisai Hokuba (Japanese, 1771–1844) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1820 Culture: Japan Medium: Privately published woodblock prints (surimono) mounted in an album; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 8 1/4 x 7 7/16 in.

Only the rain and the small boat in the distance refer to the Kabuki play Komachi Praying for Rain. The lushness of the summer scene and the fresh beauty of the women are subtly enhanced by the avoidance of color in the monochrome print.Throughout his career, Chōbunsai Eishi, son of a samurai family, focused exclusively on the subject of elegant women.

52000.jpg	Karakoto of Chojiya on Parade	Chōbunsai Eishi	Japanese	ca. 1790	An oiran, the highest class of courtesan, was accompanied by two young attendants, who were modeled on Heian pages, and two shinzo, or ladies-in-waiting, who were learning the profession. Each evening, the oiran and her entourage would parade through the streets. The young attendants wore the sleeves of their robes tied shut with a bow. The parade was as much for promotion as it was for exercise, and depictions of the ritual served as business advertisements and as fashion plates—the smart, city clothing might be copied by provincial women.The event is captured here in a dark palette known as beni-girai, or "hatred of red," which reflected a sophisticated fashion for gray and brown fabric dyes. Eishi highlights the somber range of colors with touches of peach and yellow.

Ono no Komachi, a tenth-century poetess, promises to meet her ardent suitor Fukakusa Shōjō if he agrees to spend a hundred nights on the steps of a courtly oxcart. After ninety-nine nights, he dies. This print is a play on the popular story; the beauty, dressed in a contemporary robe and holding an umbrella, may be on her way to see a lover on a snowy day. Born of a samurai family, the artist first studied under the Kano school, and the Tokugawa shogun Ieharu gave him the artistic name Eishi.

42563.jpg	Parody of the Noh Play "Hakurakuten"	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1766	Hakurakuten is a classic Noh play dealing with the intellectual debate on the relative attainments of Japanese and Chinese culture: has the Japanese waka poem achieved superiority over the venerated Tang Chinese poem? The play presents this debate in the form of a discussion between Bo Juyi (Hakurakuten) and Sumiyoshi Myōjin, the Japanese god of waka. Harunobu's print is a delightfully ludicrous rendition of this high-minded contest, substituting a Japanese girl for the god of waka and a Korean ambassador for the Chinese poet. He wears a square pendant and an official Korean costume with a high waist. Instead of poetry as the measure of national culture, the opponents face each other with paintings. Despite the pride he feels about the Chinese (or Korean) ink painting, Bo Juyi (or the Korean ambassador) cannot help but wistfully place his finger in his mouth in a traditional gesture of envy, a sign of his admiration for his lovely competitor with her painting in the Japanese ukiyo-e style.

Japan's system of cyclical dates for naming years combines the ten celestial stems with the twelve animals of the zodiac. Kinoto tori (the second of the ten stems and the zodiac sign of the rooster) appears on the left side of the warrior's neckband and "Meiwa 2" (1765) is seen on the right. The numerals for the dai, or long, months (2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10) appear inside the exposed lining of his kimono, while the numerals for the shō, or short, months (1, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12) are reversed in white and disguised as bamboo leaves on the kimono of the woman nearest the screen.

56874.jpg	Visit to a Shrine at the Hour of the Ox (Ushi no toki mairi)	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	1765	In her hands the woman carries nails and a hammer to drive them into a tree to set a curse. Known as the ushi no toki mairi (ox-hour visit), the curse is cast in the dead of night (the ox hour is around 2 a.m.) and is meant to spite either a faithless lover or a successful rival. Usually, a straw effigy was nailed to a tree near a shrine, and appropriate curses were chanted during the act. Harunobu has omitted the effigy, and the woman is not wearing the iron crown bearing three candles that was normally worn on the occasion. She also does not seem to be cursing. Instead, she looks almost as if dreaming, perhaps of sweet revenge.This is a picture-calendar (e-goyomi) for the year 1765. As shown in the diagram below, the dai and shō months for that year appear in the light patches of the pattern on the woman's kimono: the dai months appear in the upper section (some characters are illegible) and the shō months in the lower section of her kimono. Because the numbers are embossed as relief without coloration, they are extremely difficult to read. The print bears the commissioner's seal, kin, on the left side. The names of the carver, Sekine Kaei, and the artist, Suzuki Harunobu, appear in the lower left corner.

The story is incorporated in a New Year's calendar print of bijin, or beautiful women. Combining a popular subject with the associations of a holiday, he made the virtuous theme entertaining to a general Edo audience.	鈴木春信画 雪中に筍を掘る女 見立孟宗 Title: Woman Digging Bamboo Shoots in the Snow, or Parody of Meng Zong (Mōsō), from Twenty-Four Paragons of Filial Piety Artist: Suzuki Harunobu (Japanese, 1725–1770) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1765 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Vertical chūban; Image: 11 1/8 × 8 3/8 in.

45066.jpg	Poem by the Monk Sosei (act. 850-97)	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1767–68	On a misty spring day, two beauties stand under a parasol on a terrace near a torii gate in the old capital, Kyoto, viewing the cherry blossoms at their peak. Like fashion models, the two women show off their beautiful and elegant clothing. The woman on the left wears a kimono decorated with a design of pines on a sandy beach against a red ground and an obi with a bold pattern of checks. The other woman's kimono is decorated with chrysanthemums on a purple ground, and her obi has a striking design of "snow circles" (yukiwa) against a yellowish brown ground. Each protects her hair from dust with a white cloth, which is embossed. This scene is related to the famous waka poem by the monk Sosei, written across the top of the print:Looking far, I see willows and cherry blossoms mingling together—making the capital into a brocade of spring.

51995.jpg	The Bush Clover (Hagi)	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1766	Bush clover (hagi), a popular autumnal symbol, is associated with melancholy and unrequited love. A young woman plucks a branch from the purple-flowering bush. Her black kimono with a tie-dyed paulownia design and obi with a pattern of octagons and squares (shokkō) are covered with a peach-colored outer garment (katsugi). The folds of this garment and the gently curving branches of the hagi bush share the pensive mood. Her maid, holding the katsugi up out of the wet grass, turns away, discreetly avoiding her mistress's pain, a movement that increases the sense of the woman's isolation. A waka poem by the thirteenth-century poet Fujiwara Kinmori appears in the cloud-shaped cartouche above and reads:Bush CloverMy heart is withered, even dew on the branches of bush clover is futile in the autumn evening.	萩 Title: The Bush Clover (Hagi) Artist: Suzuki Harunobu (Japanese, 1725–1770) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1766 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 10 7/8 x 7 7/8 in.

56875.jpg	The Tama River at Ide, Yamashiro Province	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	probably 1766	The poetry of place and place name has a long and evocative tradition in Japanese literature. Locations, celebrated sites called meisho, often evoked a season, a certain emotion or a famous historical or fictional event. The accumulated associations were so strong that a place name became a synedoche, an indispensable device for infusing the short poetic forms of Japan with broader meaning. Ukiyo-e artists, too, made use of such allusions, both to the place and its use in classical literature, to expand and to play upon meaning.The six Tamagawa ("Jewel Rivers")—Ide, Mishima (or Kinuta), Noji, Kōya, Chōfu and Noda—were a non-traditional meisho subject that became popular in the early eighteenth century as the theme for poetry, song and dance. Harunobu most likely drew inspiration for this print series from the use of the Jewel rivers theme in the haikai circles of his day. The Tamagawa in Ide, south of the old capital, Kyoto, is the river most frequently cited by the ancient poets and, over time and accumulated imagery, came to be associated with the kerria flower, horseback riding and frogs. Harunobu's courtesan and her two younger attendants ford the river, the graceful swirls of the current cool around their feet. The square cartouche contains a poem by Shunzei (Fujiwara Toshinari, 1114–1204) from the Shinkokin waka shu anthology:Uma tometenao mizu kawanyamabuki nohana no tsuyu sofuIde no tamagawaI stop my horse and have him drink for a time where the dew falls from the kerria flowers at the Tamagawa in Ide.	井手の玉川 Title: The Tama River at Ide, Yamashiro Province Artist: Suzuki Harunobu (Japanese, 1725–1770) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: probably 1766 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 10 1/4 x 7 3/4 in.

40991.jpg	Osen Waiting on a Young Samurai	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1770	The family crest of paulownia on her kimono and the partially visible torii gate identify the subject of this print as Osen, graceful waitress of the Kagiya teahouse at the entrance to the Kasamori Inari Shrine. A young samurai, two swords at his waist, sits on a bench in a relaxed pose and turns his face to look up at Osen, who approaches to serve him tea. The beautiful Osen and the handsome gallant are the very picture of stylish Edoites from the mid-eighteenth century.

56792.jpg	Evening Chime of the Clock (Tokei no banshō), from the series “Eight Parlor Views” (Zashiki hakkei)	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1766	The orderly composition of this scene, with architectural elements arranged in parallel diagonals, reveals a private room and courtyard behind a roofed wall covered with vines. In the tightly organized space, a woman in a loose garment sits on the veranda after her bath. The maid turns her head toward the clock, partially seen at left, at the moment it strikes the hour. The woman, though listening to the clock, seems preoccupied. The traditional representation of the "evening bell" in this print from the Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers appears in the pagoda of a temple in the distance. Here, the clock stands in for the temple bell. Again, there is a subtle suggestion of a romantic narrative; the strikes of the clock may remind the woman of a lover's impending visit. The standing screen decorated with bamboo divides formal areas of the house from the intimate scene we see here.	鈴木春信画 坐鋪八景 とけひの晩鐘 Title: Evening Chime of the Clock (Tokei no banshō), from the series “Eight Parlor Views” (Zashiki hakkei) Artist: Suzuki Harunobu (Japanese, 1725–1770) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1766 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; chuban; ink and color on paper Dimensions: H. 11 1/8 in.

56881.jpg	Plucking a Branch from a Neighbor's Plum Tree	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1768	This print is an excellent example of Harunobu's artistic taste—reflecting nonsensuous tenderness and exquisiteness of figures. Casting off her sandals, a young woman has climbed onto her maid's back to break off a branch of a plum tree growing over a tall wall with a tiled ridge. The two women are elegant and gentle despite their tomboyish behavior. The rigid and monotonous pattern of bricks in the fence is a foil for the graceful figures. Despite Harunobu's depiction of these two young women as innocent, the expression "plucking a branch of plum blossoms" typically refers to a fashionably dressed female and even carries sexual overtones. The young woman wears a kimono (furisode) with hanging sleeves and a design of snow-clad bamboo. Her elaborately tied obi, or sash, has a scrolling floral pattern.

45085.jpg	Lovers Walking in the Snow (Crow and Heron)	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	1764–72	Of all ukiyo-e prints of lovers, this one creates the most romantic and melancholic mood. Harunobu emphasizes the intimacy of two lovers strolling in the snow, even suggesting perhaps a michiyuki, a path to a love suicide. The couple walk together in the quietly falling snow, in what is known as an ai ai gasa pose, literally, the sharing of an umbrella and love. Harunobu, the originator of the polychrome print, or nishiki-e, shows his mastery of color, rendering the couple's robes in paired black and white, characterized as "crow and heron." In contrast to the plain colors, he decorates both the inner robe and the obi of each figure with elaborate polychrome patterns. Embossing brings out the soft, flaky texture of the snow and the patterns of the woman's kimono and hood. This print is an early impression of this design, which was re-engraved, with slight changes, during Harunobu's lifetime or shortly afterward.

45320.jpg	Sumida River in the Snow, from the series "Famous Places in Edo in the Four Seasons"	Utagawa Hiroshige	Japanese	1834	A boatman wearing a straw hat and raincoat poles a raft along the Sumida River, which flows through the downtown area of the capital city, Edo. Snow falls all over the surface of the print, effectively sealing off the world in the picture. The dreamlike impression also extends to the indefinite border between the river and sky. The classical waka poem at the upper left can be translated as follows:Snow falls over the surface of the Sumida River, andUnmelted masses might be capital birds."Capital birds" refers to an episode from the tenth-century literary classic the Tales of Ise (Ise monogatari), in which travelers from the ancient capital, Kyoto, see a type of gull along the Sumida River that reminds them of their home far away.

56692.jpg	Dye House at Konya-cho, Kanda	Utagawa Hiroshige	Japanese	1857	In Hiroshige's day, anybody who knew Edo could recognize the city's three most prominent landmarks: distant Mount Fuji, Chiyoda Castle, and Nihon Bridge. Thus, the inclusion of the castle nestled in the townscape and Mount Fuji on the horizon leaves no doubt that this is an Edo scene. But while these features were de rigueur in depictions of the capital, positioning the viewpoint amid the windblown textiles of a dyer's drying platform was Hiroshige's innovation. He views Edo from Konya-cho, a street in the tradesmen's section of town where all the professional cloth dyers were clustered.The strips of cloth hanging in the wind are to be cut into tenugui (or towels), which men tie around their heads during the autumn festival. Thus, we know that autumn is depicted here and that the festival is near at hand.Again, cropping is used to thrust the dynamic forms of the foreground subject matter virtually on top of the viewer. The juxtaposition of various sizes of textiles, hanging like banners, lends an animated sense of rhythm to the composition. A small bird flying by itself in the middle of the sky adds a piquant touch.	名所江戸百景 神田紺屋町 Title: Dye House at Konya-cho, Kanda Artist: Utagawa Hiroshige (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1797–1858 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1857 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: H. 13 in.

The sudden shower, a favorite subject of Edo haiku poets and ukiyo-e artists, is often depicted with a crisscrossing pattern of fine lines of rain—a difficult woodblock technique. Here, the netlike pattern is superimposed over an intensely focused image of Ōhashi (the Great Bridge), which crosses the Sumida River. Utagawa Hiroshige, one of Japan's foremost landscapists, designed two extremely popular series: Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō and One Hundred Famous Views of Edo.

His black and white crest is an orange-like fruit which appears also in the pattern of his robes. The first true color printing was introduced about 1741 and is called benizuri-e. Colors are usually limited to a delicate rose red (beni) and an apple green. Kiyomitsu has added a third gray color block. The pink is a fugitive color and fades to a yellowish tone, but the green is more permanent. It is rare to find a benizuri-e preserved in something near its original state.	鳥居清満画 九代目市村羽左衛門 Title: Kabuki Actor Ichimura Uzaemon IX Artist: Torii Kiyomitsu (Japanese, 1735–1785) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1759 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 14 3/8 x 6 5/8 in.

52003.jpg	Kanjo: A Court Lady	Torii Kiyonaga	Japanese	ca. 1790	Kiyonaga's placement of women in outdoor settings paved the way for the landscape prints of the next generation. Here, the soft treatment of a willow tree beside a stream, reminiscent of both Heian poetry and Chinese brush painting, serves as a foil for the sharp, angular line of the figure.The subject is Ono no Komachi, the Heian poetess, depicted in formal jūni-hitoe, or twelve-layer court costume. The infinitely subtle shades of soft green, orange, pink, and yellow would have signified her aesthetic sensibilities to men who only glimpsed her. But through this print portrays a more modern Komachi, her face is no more expressive than the traditional hikime-kagihana, or "dashes for eyes, hook for nose," of Heian painting. Instead, she is characterized by the cherry blossoms on her robe.

His early work reflected Harunobu's wistful and romantically idealized figures. Later in his career he made a bold series of prints depicting the lavish spring fashions of the demimonde.Nishikigi wears a striking black outer robe decorated with flowering paulownia. Her kosode is patterned with a subtle, resist-dyed bamboo and is tied with a large geometric brocade sash, or obi. Her attendants, or kamuro, in the same costume and pose, wear faded purple robes decorated with hagi, or bush clover, on trellises. The motif of flowers growing on a trellis was a visual reference to the women of the Yoshiwara, who sat behind barred windows displaying themselves to potential customers.	『雛形若菜初模様 四ツ目屋内 にしき木』 Title: The Courtesan Nishikigi of the Yotsumeya Brothel, from the series “A Pattern Book of the Year’s First Designs, Fresh as Spring Herbs” (“Hinagata wakana hatsu moyō”) Artist: Isoda Koryūsai (Japanese, 1735–ca. 1790) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1776 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 14 7/8 x 10 1/8 in.

56782.jpg	Onoe Kikugorō in the role of Yaoya Oshichi and Nakamura Kiyosaburō as her lover the koshō (page) Kichisaburō	Okumura Masanobu	Japanese	1750	The invention of color block printing by the mid-eighteenth century irrevocably transformed the vigorous early ukiyo-e style. The new technique, which used separate blocks for each color, placed greater attention on coordinating the component parts and emphasized the process of color overlays. Masanobu's pioneering efforts in the field of color printing advanced a new aesthetic, one in which the essential quality of the print was dependent on line and color. As the articulation of the early ukiyo-e artist's virtuosic line diminished, a new style featuring graceful and lyrical lines bound to color harmonies emerged.

51999.jpg	Courtesans in an Iris Garden	Katsukawa Shunchō	Japanese	late 18th century	This triptych recalls one of the most popular episodes from the tenth-century literary classic, the Ise monogatari (The Tales of Ise), a series of poems on love and journeying accompanied by brief textual notes. This episode tells of a young aristocrat who happens upon a place called Eight Bridges, where a river branches into eight channels, each spanned by a bridge. Admiring the lush growth of irises, he composes a poem of five lines, each beginning with one syllable of the Japanese word for iris, which immortalized the flower's association with the place. The poem expresses his longing for a loved one left behind in the capital:I have a beloved wife,Familiar as the skirtOf a well-worn robe,And so this distant journeyingFills my heart with grief.

In this print, he shows us women working in silk production, an important occupation for women and an important part of the Edo economy. Its composition reads more like a tableau vivant, with the workers merely suggesting their activities. The inscription in the cloud-band tells us about the procedures. The mood is sensual, and the selective use of color in Utamaro's refined version of labor is delicate and idealized. The workers' robes are in shades of violet, blue, green, yellow, and pale gray.

In contrast to his rival To-shu-sai Sharaku, who exaggerated actors' climactic poses (mie) in close-up images, Toyokuni portrayed actors standing in relaxed poses. From the late eighteenth century on, Toyokuni and his numerous Utagawa-school disciples dominated the production of ukiyo-e prints of Kabuki stars.Toyokuni here presents Sawamura Sōjūrō III (1753–1801) in the role of Shimada Jūzaburō in the play Faithful Courtesans in Yoshiwara. The actor's trousers are decorated with a simplified chrysanthemum design and a stylized pattern of water known as kanze mizu, which became closely associated with Sōjūrō III and influenced textile fashion more widely. A Noh robe decorated with the kanze mizu pattern is on view in this gallery. The simplified background and kimono patterns enhance the arrested image of the actor.

52001.jpg	The Making of Silk Floss	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	ca. 1790	Utamaro's fundamental curiosity about women was not limited to any one group or activity. In this print, he shows us women working in silk production, an important occupation for women and an important part of the Edo economy. Its composition reads more like a tableau vivant, with the workers merely suggesting their activities.The inscription in the cloud-band tells us about the procedures. The mood is sensual, and the selective use of color in Utamaro's refined version of labor is delicate and idealized. The workers' robes are in shades of violet, blue, green, yellow, and pale gray.	女織蚕手業草 十 Title: The Making of Silk Floss Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1790 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 15 x 10 in.

37354.jpg	The Kitchen	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	1795	Utamaro expanded the scope of the bijin-ga, prints of beautiful women, by removing the traditional idealizing constraints of the genre and placing beautiful women in the context of ordinary life. Among the themes he explored in this broadening of his subject matter were the activities of the kitchen.

52002.jpg	Two Women	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	ca. 1790	Utamaro has set these two beauties one above the other in an unforgettable curved diagonal. The image is cropped at the right, while both look down toward the left corner. As in traditional ink painting, where negative and positive are played off against each other, here the artist has placed in opposition not only the forms themselves against the empty ground, but also the contourless, whitened faces and parted red lips against the vibrant fabric of robes and black hair. The wearing of wide obi in the late Edo period changed the way kosode were decorated. When large-scale designs were used, they were now placed on hems and the ends of sleeves. Small invertible overall patterns also became popular, such as the stencilled design of water and bamboo in this print. White ikat patterns on a dark ground, as seen here, were also prevalent. A stylish "commoner's" design, it was adapted from a rustic pattern but often woven in luxury fabrics, such as the very fine ramie cloth that may be pictured here. Ramie is a plant that yields very lustrous white fibers, which, when split very finely and joined by hand, were used to produce a high-quality, labor-intensive textile termed jōfu.

53656.jpg	The Outer Robe	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	ca. 1795	Seated figures were displayed to particular advantage in the standard, vertical oban format, which allowed the portrayal of full-length figures at close range. The robes, rather than the woman wearing them, could be said to be the subject of this print. In contrast to the practice of using outlines to contain areas of color, Utamaro here flaunts his skill by dispensing altogether with line, concentrating solely on pattern. The print is from the series Nishiki-ori Utamaro Gata ("New Patterns of Brocade in Utamaro's Style"), perhaps produced in response to his rival, Shun'ei, who at this time was making oshi egata, pasted fabric pictures. Dispensing with real fabric, Utamaro chose instead to convey lifelike reproductions of fashionable fabric.

37357.jpg	Three Intoxicated Courtesans	Kitagawa Utamaro	Japanese	1790s	Utamaro's use of silhouette to render the enormous length of the Green House and its inhabitants is unquestionably bold. Three groups of courtesans stand on a balcony, and the tops of the blossoming cherry trees in the courtyard are visible behind them. The silhouettes visible across the courtyard reinforce the almost claustrophobic lack of privacy afforded by these pleasure houses. Utamaro's inscriptions describe the various reactions people have when intoxicated. They are, from right to left: anger, crying, and laughter. This dramatic triptych displays an unusually subdued color palette for Utamaro. So limited is his palette that the artist utilizes the color of the unprinted paper as part of the design on the courtesans' robes. The large oban format became popular at the end of the eighteenth century, replacing the smaller chuban format favored by such artists as Harunobu. Utamaro's use of silhouette to render the enormouse length of the Green House and its inhabitants is unquestionably bold. Three groups of courtesans stand on a balcony, and the tops of the blossoming cherry trees in the courtyard are visible behind them. The silhouettes visible across the courtyard reinforce the almost claustrophobic lack of privacy afforded by these pleasure houses. The print is a humorous morality tale of the dangers of alchohol. Utamaro's inscriptions describe the various reactions people have when intoxicated. The are, from left to right: laughter, crying, and anger. Teacups strewn on the ground and the women's unusually animated expressions are further testimony to the hazards of drink. Courtesans were expected to be the very model of civilized women displaying intelligence, refinement, and grace. The inconsonance of this scene with the ideal only adds to its wit and affirms Utamaro's imaginative approach.	契情三人酔 三幅之内 腹立上戸 泣上戸 笑上戸 Title: Three Intoxicated Courtesans Artist: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese, ca. 1754–1806) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1790s Culture: Japan Medium: Triptych of woodblock prints; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Each H. 12 7/8 in.

45067.jpg	Young Man and Woman Caught in the Rain while Enjoying Cherry Blossoms (Sakura-gari)	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1768–70	Caught in a sudden downpour, a young woman covers her head with the long sleeve of her kimono and her male companion hastens to open an umbrella. The cloth spread on the ground near a cherry tree in full bloom indicates that they were hoping to enjoy an afternoon of merriment beneath the blossoms. The anonymous poem adds a dimension of sexual innuendo, because the word for “to be drenched” (nuru) also connotes sexual intercourse. It reads: Sakura-gari ame wa furikinu onajiku wa nuru to mo hana no kage ni kakuren.While searching for cherry blossoms, it starts to rain, yet even if we get drenched,we will still be in the shade of these flowering trees.—Trans.

Two young people appear distracted and isolated from each other—the man holding what appears to be a love letter and the seated woman holding a samisen, a three-stringed instrument associated with the pleasure quarters. Inscribed in the cartouche at the upper corner is a famous waka (thirty-one-syllable court poem) by the medieval monk-poet Saigyō (1118–1190) that reads: Kokoro naki mi ni mo aware wa shirarekeri shigi tatsu sawa no aki no yūgureEven those who hide feelingswill sense the melancholy—of a snipe taking flight over a marshon an autumn evening.—Trans.

The artist puns on a classical poem by Fujiwara no Shunzei (1114–1204) that refers to opening the gates of the heavens (ama no to) by showing a young woman opening rain shutters (amado).

57034.jpg	Young Women Playing Kitsune-ken (Fox Game)	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1768–69	The spaciousness of the interior in this print extends to the exterior space of the veranda and the blossoming cherry trees beyond the railing, creating a pleasant atmosphere. The joyous mood is echoed by two figures in the foreground playing the fox game (kitsune-ken). Another young woman, with a three-stringed samisen in her left hand, watches their game. On the floor between the contestants are a kettle and a stand holding a sake cup.The basic idea of kitsune-ken is that three hand gestures symbolize a village chief, a gun, and a fox. Each has a different potential: the chief is superior to the gun since he employs it, the gun to the fox because it can kill the fox, and the fox to the chief because it can bewitch him. The use of the hands (ken means "fist") leads to a number of combinations. In this print, the player on the right who makes a gesture of shooting a rifle defeats her opponent at the left, whose limp-wristed gesture signifies a fox. The game continues until one player wins three times in succession. The loser in this print will have to drink a cup of sake.

Ono no Komachi (active ca. 850) was the only woman of the six. One of her famous waka (court poems) accompanies the imaginary portrait showing Komachi in flowery Edo-style robes.

The title of this series includes the phrase rokkasen, which sounds like it should mean Six Poetic Immortals, but the character for “poetry” has been playfully substituted with the one for “flower,” suggesting that the women of the pleasure quarters are being compared to beautiful flowers. Each print in this series has a different flower in the title cartouche; here, a peony is included.	鳥文斎栄之画 「青楼美人六花仙 丁子屋雛鶴鸖」 Title: The Courtesan Hinazuru of the Chōjiya Brothel (Chōjiya Hinazuru), from the series Beauties of the Pleasure Quarters as Six Floral Immortals (Seirō bijin rokkasen) Artist: Chōbunsai Eishi (Japanese, 1756–1829) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1795 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 13 7/8 x 9 5/8 in.

51087.jpg	Rain of the Fifth Month (Samidare)	Utagawa Kunisada	Japanese	19th century	Kunisada's vision of an early summer scene, luxuriant in the soft rain of the fifth month, reflects a new sensibility for landscape among late Edo artists. The unhurried pleasures of a warm summer day seem heightened by the soft rain, which hardly affects the activities of the travelers, fisherman, and groom. A bright light infuses the atmosphere and is enhanced by the unusual use of blue pigment for the evenly spaced, vertical lines of rain. Utagawa Kunisada, known as Toyokuni III, designed more prints for the mass market than any other artist of his time.

55735.jpg	Ejiri in Suruga Province (Sunshū Ejiri), from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei)	Katsushika Hokusai	Japanese	ca. 1830–32	Mount Fuji is shown without clouds, which were probably blown away by strong winds. Travelers along a meandering path on the Tōkaidō highway fight against the gusts, which are ripping papers from a pack and hats from their heads. The trees sway, and leaves dance in the sky. The frantic movements in the foreground contrast with the stillness of the mountain in the distance.	冨嶽三十六景 駿州江尻 Title: Ejiri in Suruga Province (Sunshū Ejiri), from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei) Artist: Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1830–32 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Oban 9 7/8 x 14 3/4 in.

This one-to-one relationship makes not only for a strong visual analogy between mountain and man but also for a potent iconographical one. The juxtaposition of the cooper and Fuji lends a religious overtone to the man's honest labor and existence.	冨嶽三十六景 尾州不二見原 Title: Fujimigahara in Owari Province (Bishū Fujimigahara), from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei) Artist: Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1830–32 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 10 1/16 x 14 7/8 in.

The rectangular porch in which they are enclosed functions as a "picture within a picture," a smaller, isolated composition that can stand on its own but that usually adds something critical to the viewer's experience of the work. In this print, the isolated scene of colorful figures grabs our attention and, through the pointing gesture of the waitress, leads our eye in the direction of Fuji.	冨嶽三十六景 礫川雪の旦 Title: Morning after the Snow at Koishikawa in Edo (Koishikawa yuki no ashita), from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei) Artist: Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1830–32 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 10 1/8 x 15 in.

Known as "Red Fuji," this print presents Hokusai's uncompromising vision of Mount Fuji without a human presence. The majestic snow-capped Mount Fuji embodies an iconic spirituality that approaches the religious. Trees are reduced to tiny triangles of green stretching along Fuji's base, and the blue sky with a white-paper-like pattern of clouds adds a decorative flourish to the design.	冨嶽三十六景 凱風快晴 Title: South Wind, Clear Sky (Gaifū kaisei), also known as Red Fuji, from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei) Artist: Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1830–32 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Oban 10 x 14 7/8 in.

A lightning bolt shown against the shape of Fuji opens up a dialogue of oppositions: the enduring, static Mount Fuji is pitted against the transitory and fleeting nature of lightning. The solemn, towering mountain remains undisturbed by dangerous thunderstorms.	冨嶽三十六景 山下白雨 Title: Storm below Mount Fuji (Sanka no haku u), from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei) Artist: Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1830–32 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 10 x 14 3/4 in.

This repetition of color serves to flatten out the scene, bridging the distance between near and far. The mast and sails of the large junk create an interesting play of triangular forms that reflect and frame the form of Fuji in the distance.	冨嶽三十六景 上総の海路 Title: At Sea off Kazusa (Kazusa no kairo), from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei) Artist: Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1830–32 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 9 1/2 x 14 7/8 in.

This view of Mount Fuji and its reflection in the placid lake can be seen from Misaka Pass, reached by the Isawa road, which branches off the main road to Edo. Hokusai balanced the composition by placing the mountain slightly to the right and its reflection to the left. The lone fisherman in his boat enhances the serenity. Ironically, the reflection of Mount Fuji shows a snow-capped peak, an element missing from the mountain itself. The two views of the mountain perhaps represent two seasons, with the traditional and more familiar view being the image in the water. This pictorial trick encourages the viewer to focus on the reflection	冨嶽三十六景 甲州三坂水面 Title: Reflection in Lake at Misaka in Kai Province (Kōshū Misaka suimen), from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei Artist: Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1830–32 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 9 5/8 x 14 3/4 in.

A towering cypress is embraced by travelers who express their exuberance and triumph at reaching the ancient tree. Even Mount Fuji in the distance is dwarfed by the monumental tree. The contrast of the small human figures and the giant natural forms reveals Hokusai's empathy with the travelers.	冨嶽三十六景 甲州三島越 Title: Mishima Pass in Kai Province (Kōshū Mishima goe), from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei Artist: Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese, Tokyo (Edo) 1760–1849 Tokyo (Edo)) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1830–32 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 9 5/8 x 14 7/8 in.

56417.jpg	Jewel River at Ide (Ide no Tamagawa)	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1768	Holding the skirts of their kimonos above the water, three women wade in a shallow stream from a bank where yamabuki flowers grow. With elegance and great care they are venturing across the river. This particular print shows a famous scenic place on the Jewel River at Ide in Yamashiro Province, modern Kyoto. A square cartouche bears a title and a poem by the celebrated poet Fujiware no Shunzei (1114–1204): Tamagawa at Ide by ShunzeiAs I stop my horse to give him water, dew from the yamabuki flowers is lost in the stream of Tamagawa at Ide. (trans. by Miyeko Murase) The images of the three women are borrowed from the illustrated book by Nishikawa Sukenobu (1671–1751) entitled Ehon Chitose-yama (Picture Book: Thousand-Year Mountain), displayed next to this print. In Harunobu's print, it is not clear why the maid on the right is looking over her shoulder. However, in Sukenobu's illustration, the maid actually looks back at a fourth figure behind her. Ignoring the fourth woman, Harunobu borrowed only three figures from Sukenobu's illustration, almost cutting them out for transplant into his print. A significant change in Harunobu's print is the treatment of the women's feet, which are visible under the clear water.	井手の玉川 Title: Jewel River at Ide (Ide no Tamagawa) Artist: Suzuki Harunobu (Japanese, 1725–1770) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1768 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 10 3/4 x 7 7/16 in.

56419.jpg	The Cloth-Fulling Jewel River, a Famous Place in Settsu Province (Tōi no Tamagawa, Settsu no meisho), from an untitled series of Six Jewel Rivers (Mu Tamagawa)	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1766–67	One of a series of scenes from Mutamagawa (Six Jewel Rivers), this print illustrates two women, probably a mother and daughter, beating cloth under a candle hung on the pillar in an earthen-floored room. The fulling of cloth signifies a quiet autumn evening. Seen through a bamboo window is a tree with persimmons, another autumnal motif. A single towel hung over a rod deepens the homely but lonely atmosphere.Two small prints on the wall illustrate fireworks near a bridge over the Sumida River in Edo in summer and the viewing of the moon in autumn. They are depicted as benizuri-e, examples of an old printmaking method that used only two colors. The appearance of these benizuri-e within a polychrome color print, demonstrating the new "brocade" technique invented by Harunobu, allowed the viewer to savor the contrast.The subject of Mutamagawa, developed from the classical theme of beautiful rivers employed to represent famous scenic places in waka poems, was eventually standardized, probably in the Edo period, to form a group of six Jewel Rivers. As described in the poem, this scene depicts the Jewel River flowing through a renowned picturesque location in Settsu, modern Osaka:Fulling of Cloth at Tamagawa by Lady SagamiThe autumn wind over the pines sounds forlorn.In the loneliness, the sound of fulling cloth at Tamagawa.(trans. by Miyeko Murase)The poem was actually composed by Minamoto Toshiyori (ca. 1055-1129), not by Lady Sagami, as stated in the inscription.	鈴木春信画 六玉川 「壔衣の玉川 摂津の名所」Kōromō Uchi Tamagawa Title: The Cloth-Fulling Jewel River, a Famous Place in Settsu Province (Tōi no Tamagawa, Settsu no meisho), from an untitled series of Six Jewel Rivers (Mu Tamagawa) Artist: Suzuki Harunobu (Japanese, 1725–1770) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1766–67 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print (nishiki-e); ink and color on paper Dimensions: 10 3/4 x 7 7/8 in.

The woman here is rinsing cloth in the shoals of the river but looks almost as if dancing with the waving cloth. Use of the technique of embossing subtly reveals the cloth's thickness.

The text in the square cartouche is a famous poem by the monk Kōbō Daishi (Kūkai, 774–835) about one of the Six Jewel Rivers, the one in Kii Province (now Wakayama prefecture).

56507.jpg	Osen of the Kagiya Teahouse at Kasamori Shrine with a View of Nippori in Yanaka	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1768	The Kagiya teahouse, located in the precinct of the Kasamori Inari Shrine in the capital, Edo, is depicted in the foreground. The landscape of Higurashinosato (Nippori) is seen in the background, including a popular spot for the recreational activity of throwing dishes over a cliff to watch their trajectory, which is depicted at top right.Tea shops, commonly found near the entrance to Shinto shrines, became popular meeting places during the Edo period, as much the object of the excursion as the actual visit to the shrine. Osen, a young tea maid at the Kagiya shop, located in front of the torii entrance to Kasamori Shrine, was made famous by Harunobu's several depictions of her and was perhaps the real object of his visits there during the late 1760s. Here, she turns coyly from an importunate admirer. Another tea maid, near a bench at the left, tries to ward off a bold customer's advance. The arriving party of four might be participating in a pilgrimage to the shrine. The lighthearted, hedonistic nature of these popular pilgrimages is amply evident in Harunobu's depiction of this scene, which includes one of his few landscape depictions.

56603.jpg	Scene from the Play "Keisei Kaneni Sakura"	Torii Kiyohiro	Japanese	1756	Kiyohiro, whose works appeared between the a740s and 1760s, worked primarily in two- and three-color prints (benizuri-s). He eschewed the earlier technique of brushing color onto prints and instead applied rose-red and green, the sof colors that characterize his work.The play depicted in this print adapts the tragic story of the eighth-century Chinese Emperor Hsuan-tsung and his concubine, Yang Kyei-fei. Performed at the Morita Theater during the New Year season in 1756, it featured the actors Ichikawa Masuzō and Azuma Tōzō, who were frequently cast as hunband and wife. Although the Chinese origin of the subject is conveyed in the loose, Chinese-style garments and jeweled caps, there is little else Chinese about this print. By setting his actors under a cherry tree and wrapping them in robes marked with large, typically Japanese actors' crests and linked hexagons and double-petal cherry motifs, Kiyohiro has completely transformed the subject, conveying the tender mood in line and color.

56610.jpg	Kabuki Actor	Attributed to Torii Kiyonobu I	Japanese	ca. 1708	Kiyonobu, founder of the Torii line of artists, specialized in the painting of posters and signboards for the popular Kabuki theater. As required by the poster format, the bold, fluid lines, full, rounded forms, and flattened patterning were to be read at a distance. Kiyonobu's early experimentation with hand coloring was undertaken to enliven the stark black and white designs and to further the print's decorative appeal.Kiyonobu's masterful depiction of a dancer recalls Moronobu's expressive portrayal of lovers in this exhibition. Both convey a freedom of spirit and emotion through the use of vibrant, expressive line. In a manner unique to the early ukiyo-e style, Kiyonobu animates the dancer's robe with fluid lines, swirling patterns, and floral motifs to suggest her exuberant movement and essential vitality.

37366.jpg	Segawa Tomisaburō II as Yadorigi in the Play "Hana Ayame Bunroku Soga"	Tōshūsai Sharaku	Japanese	1794	Female roles in Kabuki theater were acted by oyama or onnagata, men who specialized in female impersonation. The skill and ambiguous dual status of such performers were a source of great fascination to the Kabuki audience. Here, for example, the clothing, coiffure, and gesture of the male actor epitomize those of a fashionable and beautiful woman. Indeed, in his imitation of a woman's gesture, the actor tugs at his garment with a sinuous feminine panache more exaggerated than real. Yet, reflecting the contradictory status of the actor, Sharaku has subtly confirmed the distinctively male squareness of Segawa Tomisaburō II's jawline.One of the means by which Sharaku gave his portraits of Kabuki actors great force was the sharp contrast between the figure and the monochrome background. This monochrome consisted of a layer of deep indigo blue ink onto which silver mica dust was sprinkled. As this print demonstrates, the lush background set off the colors of the face and kimono to great effect.

Sharaku depicts him furtively rubbing his hands inside his kimono, a conventional gesture indicating his guilty awareness of the evil deed he is about to commit.Sharaku was a master at designing forceful graphic images. In this portrait, the strength of his draftsmanship is concentrated in the drapery folds and the varied lines of the facial features, where the essence of this character could be best expressed. The clipped starting points and tapered ends of individual lines are reminiscent of lines painted with a brush, yet the graphic quality is typical of the woodblock-print medium.	八代目守田勘弥の鴬の次郎作 Title: Kabuki Actor Morita Kan’ya VIII as the Palanquin-Bearer in the Play A Medley of Tales of Revenge (Katakiuchi noriaibanashi) Artist: Tōshūsai Sharaku (Japanese, active 1794–95) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 5th month, 1794 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink, color, white mica on paper Dimensions: 15 x 10 in.

56680.jpg	At the Tsutsui Well	Chōbunsai Eishi	Japanese	ca. 1781–1800	The two left panels of this triptych depict the love of a young man and woman who were next-door neighbors and playmates during their childhood. The artist Eishi quotes their love poems from The Tales of Ise along the top of the composition. The man sent to his love:By the barrel-well'sbuilt-up crib I'd pull myselfmeasuring my height:I've grown to be a manthis long while we've been apart.The girl sent back:Since we vied for heightmy once childish hair has grownbeyond my shoulders: If it is not to be you,who then best should tie it up?The print cleverly combines this story of lovers whose bond was to endure throughout their lives with a story related earlier in The Tales of Ise about an unfortunate young man who, after a year, reminisces about his lost love. The poem he recites upon returning to the now-deserted residence of his beloved is quoted at the top of the sheet on the right side of the triptych:The moon: is it not . . .the spring: is it not . . . last year'sspring yet unchanged? No,this body of mine aloneseems the same as once before.Although the text of The Tales of Ise makes no connection between these two nonsequential episodes, the illustration brings them together as if to comment that both are stories of love and the passage of time, though time strengthened love in one case and deepened its sadness in the other. This subtle interpretation, however, is represented in the form of a mitate, a humorous contemporary parody of a classical narrative: all the players are shown as beautiful Edo-period women in the lavish costumeof their own time.

56684.jpg	Autumn, from the series Women’s Pleasures of the Four Seasons	Utagawa Kuniyoshi	Japanese	ca. 1844–46	After governmental restrictions of the 1840s were loosened, Kuniyoshi made a sumptuous series of prints of women in the four seasons. All four of the triptychs in the series present three women with a child. This print, the best of the four, illustrates the women and a boy viewing the moon from boats. The misty clouds covering the moon are delicately depicted with light ink and silver powder (presently tarnished). Kuniyoshi included a severely cropped bridge support pole in the right border and arranged the reflection of the lantern in the waves In the cartouche at the upper right corner a poem by Genkō is inscribed "Look at that, then look up at the sky, and admire the moon with geese."

His daughter Ayako appears in the left panel. Immediately following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, there was much discontentment, particularly among the samurai who had lost all of their earlier prestige and privileges. Many Satsuma samurai far to the west were among the most reactionary, and when swords were prohibited in January 1877, their hatred of the government came to a head. The famous Satsuma Rebellion broke out in early 1877 under Saigo's leadership and lasted six months, with the fighting confined to Satsuma, itself. Saigo was wounded and at his own request, decapitated on the battlefield. His 40,000 samurai, traditionally the country's military elite had been defeated by an equal number of soldiers drafted into the newly-formed conscript army.

55567.jpg	Kabuki Actors: Bando Mitsugorō and Iwai Hanshirō	Utagawa Toyokuni I	Japanese	ca. 1800	Toyokuni employed various figure arrangements—a single actor, or two actors shown standing or from the waist up. Here, two actors occupy almost the entire sheet, which is rare in Toyokuni's theatrical prints. The actors, Bandō Mitsugorō in a male role and Iwai Hanshirō in a female role, stand close together under a large umbrella, dominating the small space. The rounded, almost drooping upper-right corners of the characters in the artist's signature suggest a date of about 1800, when the forms and lines of Toyokuni's images, in contrast, started to become a little more rigid.

55584.jpg	Street Scene in Yoshiwara	Hishikawa Moronobu 菱川師宣	Japanese	late 17th century	In this Yoshiwara scene by Moronobu, the originator of ukiyo-e prints, a courtesan leans on the lattice of a teahouse window and converses with a samurai who has draped a coat over his head. This attempt to cloak his identity only serves to attract the attention of the courtesan playing the samisen and the passersby. The profile view of the girl's face, which is unusual in ukiyo-e prints, emphasizes the interest with which she watches the exchange. The focus of the print is the interaction between the inside, which is framed within the barred window of the teahouse, and the outside. Those on the inside look out, and those on the outside look in.

55590.jpg	Blowing Soap Bubbles Under the Plum Blossom	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese		In this print the device is again employed of a classical poem incorporated into a cloudlike formation at the top. The poem reads, freely: "I do not want my mind to be tainted by the smell and color of the plums, but the wind stealthily carries the mysterious scent and color into my sleeve." Under a plum blossom tree, a mother blows bubbles as her son watches with amusement. The use of the plum, a symbol of sexuality and eroticism, coupled with the mother's activity and the child's celebratory dancing, seems to suggest the act of procreation and the value of maternity.	梅 Title: Blowing Soap Bubbles Under the Plum Blossom Artist: Suzuki Harunobu (Japanese, 1725–1770) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 11 x 8 in.

55593.jpg	Evening Snow on Matsuchi Hilll, from the series Eight Fashionable Views of Edo (Furyu Edo hakkei)	Suzuki Harunobu	Japanese	ca. 1765–70	Sugoroku, still current, is played with counters and a single die; the board game involves a race to the finish. The woman at the right is about to throw the die as the other makes her "move" on the board. Whoever reaches the goal first is the winner. Despite the cold weather, the shoji are drawn back to reveal Mount Matsuchi, a site in Edo famous for its snowy vistas. The well-structured landscape seems almost like a painting. In the middle ground snow-covered cottages and moored boats are arranged behind trees that are cut off in the foreground by the window frame. On top of the distant cliff at the left stands the famous temple Shōtengu, dedicated to the popular cult for the Esoteric Buddhist deity Kankiten (in Sanskrit, Nandikeshvara). On the right, a bridge crosses a river, probably the Asakusa River in Edo. The poem written at the top, inside a cloud-shaped cartouche, reads:White snow is piled along the road on Matsuchi Hill. Every tree seems to be blossoming in the twilight.	風流江戸八景 真乳山の暮雪 Title: Evening Snow on Matsuchi Hilll, from the series Eight Fashionable Views of Edo (Furyu Edo hakkei) Artist: Suzuki Harunobu (Japanese, 1725–1770) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: ca. 1765–70 Culture: Japan Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 11 x 8 1/8 in.

55595.jpg	"At the Edge of the River Akutagawa" from the Tales of Ise (Ise monogatari)	Sugimura Jihei	Japanese		One of the stories in The Tales of Ise that Edo-period readers loved best was the episode of the abduction of a young noble lady by the amorous hero. These two scenes originally were mounted together as a single composition so the viewer could appreciate the witty juxtaposition of the widely divergent interpretations of the story. The lower picture closely follows traditional illustrations of this passage: the young man carries his beloved piggyback before a willow tree. The Edo artist has even retained the lengthwise format of a traditional handscroll illustration. The larger scene above is a humorous modern Edo revision of the classical story: the girl lies with her abductor with the air of a willing accomplice to his amorous adventure. To leave no doubt as to her role in this scene, the Edo artist deliberately placed the reclining lovers atop a large pair of pine needles that, in the parlance of Edo slang, symbolizes the illicit union of two conspirators. This piquant contrast between the stuffy traditional view and its racy contemporary parody is further underscored by the contrast in styles: the tightly focused descriptive scene below is replaced by the dynamic swirling lines and mixed motifs in the close-up view of figures above.

55624.jpg	Splendor of the Procession of General Grant from America (Beikoku Guranto-shi go tsūkō no han'ei)	Toyohara Kunichika	Japanese	1879	This print was commissioned to commemorate the former American president's visit to Tokyo (Edo was renamed Tokyo when the emperor made it his residence in 1868) and his attendance at a Kabuki performance. Like many prints executed during the Meiji era, this one acted as a type of Japanese photojournalism. As such, the speed with which it was executed and the number of copies made are partly responsible for the general decline in quality most noticeable in the color registration and uneven paint application. The setting of the print can be identified as Tokyo's new Western-style Main Street located in the Ginza district and designed by the English architect Thomas Waters. In their choice of setting, Kunichika and Kunisada III consciously celebrate the advent of modernism in Japan. Likewise, the artists made a bold statement of the Meiji era's strong nationalistic sentiment by the repetition of Japan's newly adopted flag and by the rhythms created by the pattern of the flags' brillian red centers. The bold silhouettes of hte seven Kabuki actors, one of whom wears a Western bowler hat, dominate the print as they watch Grant's silhouetted procession. According to Julia Meech, the dramatic emphasis of the actors' silhouettes recalls the tradition of Japanese shadow theater, a premise strengthened by the hand gestures made by four group members.	米国グラント氏御通行之繁栄 Title: Splendor of the Procession of General Grant from America (Beikoku Guranto-shi go tsūkō no han'ei) Artist: Toyohara Kunichika (Japanese, 1835–1900) Period: Meiji period (1868–1912) Date: 1879 Culture: Japan Medium: Triptych of woodblock prints; ink and color on paper Dimensions: 14 3/4 x 29 3/4 in.

55914.jpg	Parody of the Third Princess and Kashiwagi: “Chapter 50: A Hut in the Eastern Provinces”	Utagawa Kunisada	Japanese	1858, second month	Through his illustrations of A Fraudulent Murasaki’s Rustic Genji, single-sheet prints, triptychs, and diptychs, Utagawa Kunisada was more prolific than any other ukiyo-e artist in the creation of Genji-themed prints. This pair of prints is thirty-seventh in a group of thirty-eight diptychs from the series Lasting Impressions of a Late Genji Collection (Genji goshū yojō), published between 1857 and 1861. The most complex and visually satisfying of Kunisada’s Genji images, this series was lavishly printed on thick paper to allow special effects such as blind printing (karazuri) or textile-weave printing (nunomezuri). The metallic pigments, the burnishing (shōmenzuri), and the overall luxurious presentation usually characterize deluxe privately published prints called surimono.	歌川国貞（三代歌川豊国）画 「源氏後集余情 五十のまき / あづまや」 Title: Parody of the Third Princess and Kashiwagi: “Chapter 50: A Hut in the Eastern Provinces” Artist: Utagawa Kunisada (Japanese, 1786–1864) Period: Edo period (1615–1868) Date: 1858, second month Culture: Japan Medium: Diptych of woodblock prints; ink and color on paper Dimensions: Each 14 1/4 x 9 3/4 in.
